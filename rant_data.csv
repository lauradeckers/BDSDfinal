Because, all jobs I’ve landed are entry-level jobs that are purposeless and do not allow proper motivational work. 

Right now, I’m in crisis mode as I’m the only person on this part of the team and my boss is having emotional outbursts at me at least once a week for no good reason. It’s to the point that I feel physically sick with anxiety. I’m quite certain he’s throwing my character under the bus to his manager too, to make it look like he has it all under control, and nobody else will have to catch wind of these ungrounded outbursts. All this while I’m multitasking three physical operations at once at any time of the day, while also trying to maintain data logging/tracking and inventories in between all that. This is hell.

Ive been told time and time again by those superior to my role, to keep hanging on and climb the ladder. Nothing about companies appeal me, and any notion to make them more ideal in the lens of a future sustainable society is pretty much bullshit.


It’s to the point that all I want to do is remote work from home jobs for governing bodies, then use my free mental resources from this to take up creative hobbies I’ve missed working on.

Hoping there’s someone here who disagrees with that voice in my head telling me that all this makes me an abysmal failure.

Edit: 
Forgot to mention, any work from home job I am eligible for would be pretty much easy admin stuff without much need for me degree.

Sorry, this is not ""I quit my unfulfilling job"" vibes (did that last year!) But rather ""welp I'm in middle management during the most collectively stressful and antiwork movement of my life, how to make things better"". My company is awesome and I do manage to find things to like about my work, I'd like to keep it going! 

Can't give too many details but basically our company is the very definition of middle management as we function as an intermediary between freelancers and corporations who need them. Think Mechanical Turk like jobs but paid 10-40x better and run by a super small company. That being said, I'm sure no freelancer has the time or interest to look it up and see how small we are, and we don't make people rich for sure, it's very much sidegigs for most people tho a few talented freelancers might make enough to have some nice monthly wages working 2 days a week. I was a freelancer myself and always enjoyed getting gigs here since they were low effort and high pay, but it's not something I saw myself doing for a living and the employer is just a faceless page like Upwork + some emails from a few people, you know? I didn't imagine that 5 people run everything, found out when they called me in for full time. Hell, I spent the first 2 months being mega suspicious and waiting for the other ball to drop before I realised that it's just nice hardworking people working in a super niche field that is known to be sketchy and exploitative but they choose not to be. 

Anyway, so I found myself a faceless manager assigning tasks by email to people who I'll never meet and... It's been harsh. I try to be as nice and human as possible, and some seem nice in emails, but 8/10 they do a... Pretty shitty job. I sometimes redo the whole job myself on my own time if I'm qualified for it. A lot of the bad jobs come from people who used to do good jobs, but understably I guess when you get paid anyway you shit on company time. It's pretty bad since the bad jobs then need someone to fix them, fixing pays less than originally doing them, so everyone is all around upset. I don't think it's the worker's lack of skill so much as... Let's face it, it's a faceless portal and you're part of a large pipeline whose end result you can't see or often even predict. Job meaning satisfaction is not something you can get from it. It's predictable that you wouldn't do your best or be loyal for any reason. 

What are some good ways to get people motivated in this case? Pay is not one, since we already pay quite well. I'm not sure how we could be less of a faceless task provider to offer more satisfaction for the soul and get people motivated. We can't exactly leak the pipeline to show how their work improves some prodicra as we have an NDA with the clients. Other managers are just stricter when a bad job's been done and make them redo repeatedly, but personally I would find it frustrating (and getting feedback from a faceless person is, well, intimidating I think. )

Spamming out easy-apply applications on Indeed and LinkedIn, not bothering with cover letters or tailoring my resume. Not looking ""hard"" for a job right now. I'm in helpdesk work, so there's a lot out there.

Long story short (ish):I get a reply from one of the recruiters posting on LinkedIn via chat. They make sure I have Zoom for a remote interview, they're representing a company that is based (they say) in Massachusetts. Their question comes in at noon (Pacific) on Monday and I answer 20 minutes later. I don't get a reply again until 1am (Pacific) and that reply is giving me their HR hiring person's email address to add on Zoom to set up an interview and get more specifics about the job.

So I wake up at 9am and add the person (with a .org email address) and introduce myself, give context to the intro, and attempt to set up an interview time. Apparently the interview is right now and will take 40ish minutes. Throughout the process the interviewer is obviously using an autofill script and basically telling me to hold questions until the end. Annoying but okay, they've gotta go through this several times a day, so I get it. Fast forward to 40 minutes of inane, cookie-cutter interview questions later (""what makes you want to work for X company?"" type of stuff) and we get to the part where I can ask questions.

""You say the training pay is x, but x is lower than my state's minimum wage. I'd need to be earning at least that minimum wage even during training.""

""The pay is x during training, and y after that.""

I repeat that this won't work, I'd be concerned about the legality and the initial lack of respect being paid less than minimum wage.

""What is the minimum wage in your state?""

We go back and forth a bit and the interviewer comes back with needing to talk to their financial department to get this sorted. I tell them to let me know when they have an answer. They come back with a revised statement basically saying ""Okay, give me all this info and we'll move forward at the state minimum wage."" This took less than 3 minutes so obviously no confirmation from another department. I ask to clarify if we're operating under an assumption or if they're guaranteeing this higher wage. I'm assured I'll be paid the minimum wage.

Another scripted ""give me all these pieces of personally identifiable information and a copy (front and back) of your driver's license""... hol up, red flag, I go into research a bit. I explain that I'm not comfortable giving all the info and not even convinced this process is legitimate. They give me a company website and a link to the ""careers"" page (I'm already on their site but there isn't a header for this careers page) so I go a bit deeper.

The website domain was established in November 2021 and the careers page exists but all the links to jobs on the page are dead links. So I block the ""interviewer"" and report the job on LinkedIn.

I get that this maybe isn't specifically an anti-work sort of post, but seriously, be careful out there people. Don't get too eager to get a job that you allow yourself to be taken in by one of these predatory clowns.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Edit to add: apparently the LinkedIn system took all of 7 minutes to review my report and conclude that their job posting doesn't break any rules. Nevermind that they didn't bother to ask for any details... /facepalm. Look out for ""RSM Logistics"". The .com company looks legit. The .org company does not.","Isn't it bad enough that we have to deal with crappy employers, but now we need to avoid job selling scammers as well? More for your own caution and a bit of a rant.",18

TLDR: former small business taken over by new business owner who is at least a month late on our store opening yet owns multiple business across US and Europe (allegedly) and is a “recruiter” , making bizarre decisions over employees heads with no communication (hearing more information from random uninvolved community members instead of owner) and confusing clients by using previous owner’s clout. Red flags or no?

I have had the same job working in a small business French pastry shop since I was 17 (now 22). I was hired through a friend who worked there. Recently (December 2021) our owner and our one chef made the decision to retire and close the shop. We were very popular in our community, so it was a great loss per say, but it was the right thing for our owner to do for herself and our staff was very supportive and happy for that. She made it very clear to our clients that she was not selling or reopening. She was closing her business and the space will be available for rent. 

During our closing she talked a lot with this man who wanted to open his own French pastry shop the following year in the same space and she gave him a lot of advice. He also offered us employees jobs and told us he would be opening mid January (still has not opened). I personally was very hesitant because I felt like he was taking advantage of our old owners advice (she is French and this man has no experience in French pastry), because he owns multiple businesses across the country, and simply for the fact that it was a great place to work and it won’t be the same now. I ended up telling him that I would give it a try because it’s not like I had another job lined up. He has made it seem like he is very laid back and flexible and wanting to have a tight knit team with lots of discussion but many things have gone over our heads already such as not opening on time with no further communication on why or when we actually would be opening. He also told us that when he opens he is going to keep it as similar as possible to the previous business before he tries to make any changes. Today multiple friends sent me a screenshot of this seemingly “viral” email going around our town from this lady who walked up to the shop and happened to meet the new owner. Allegedly she was told that the shop would be opening next week with the same owner and same pastry chef, which is absurdly untrue. She was obviously under the impression that the original business was re opening, which is also untrue. 

He also made the bizarre decision to change one letter of the original business name (he could not use the original name because it was not for sale by our original owner). I feel that he thinks that it will be less confusing to the community but really just wants to keep the clientele from the old business. It’s also why he wanted to keep us employees. If anything it’s more confusing because it’s undone the clarity that our old boss made by saying she was CLOSING. Not selling or reopening. And now us employees will have to explain that this is an entirely new business because the new owner is advertising it as if it’s a reopening of the same business. He also has a website that features online ordering and has our OLD Facebook linked. We never had a real website or online ordering in the past because we did not have the capacity or space or staff to do such handling. If he has figured it out good for him but this is an example of something he claimed would be a discussion first and it is not something any of us older employees would have wanted. On top of that if I were given a schedule to start working next week (something else he hasn’t spoken to us about yet) that would not be ok with me. I’m regretting not looking for another job during these two months but I was under the impression I would be back at work by now. 

Am I crazy or are these red flags?? The email is what sent me over the ledge to make this post and I really want to try and find another job before this mfer opens so I can tell him I’m not working for him anymore. The problem is I don’t have a resume because of this being the only job I ever had and being hired through a friend. I do have one that I used to apply to college but with only high school accomplishments. However, I was very active in student orgs in college. So should I get to work on that and ditch this man or see it through because it’s a job I’ve already secured? 

ETA: another disadvantage is I’ve never had a job interview. How could I make sure I’m not being taken advantage of because of my loyalty to my one job?",(RANT) Working for a new business owner,4

I've been with this job since 2018 and it's been a mostly miserable ride. What made this job most unpleasant above all was how invisible I felt to my coworkers. I always made a point to be beyond kind, be approachable, and go out of my way to help others with their load when I could without complaint! This was all for nothing though because there was no real effort to get to know me beyond shallow smiles and small talk. Over time this drove me crazy because seeing everyone else so buddy buddy with each other while I watched from the sidelines fucking sucked.

Anyway, me and a fellow co-worker have been excited about our last day and it had been announced multiple times that the date was coming up soon. Friday finally comes and our boss starts the day with an office game to boost morale or whatever (pin the tail on the unicorn). Afterwards, they call ""Lisa"" to the front to be awarded a goodbye plaque, giving a heartfelt speech and all that. That ends and then it's followed with ""Alright so here's the plan for Monday blah blah blah"". Boss completely skipped over me and only realized it when others started whispering ""what about..?"" gesturing towards me. Then he suddenly says ""Omg I totally forgot omg so sorry"".

Last year I worked my damn ass off improving my skills, taking critiques seriously from my boss, and I made so many improvements with projects and the business.

My annual review was a couple weeks ago and guess what my raise was? Only 3%. Are you kidding me? I got a pay cut for working my ass off?! I am pissed and at a loss. What they said was oh but you do get bonuses and benefits so it’s okay.

Everyone there freaking gets these too! So I’ve been working on my resume and casually searching for jobs. I’m worried though that I do not have enough experience that no one will want to hire me.

I felt like I did everything right. I got a 4.0 throughout my college years held multiple internships and a job during college. Everything was supposed to come together. At first, I was very excited to pave my way. I began applying for employment with an over-the-top amount of enthusiasm. However, over the next six months, my excitement has started to change. I interviewed for countless jobs and was told the same thing. Either they did not want me, wanted me to work insane hours, or offered me enough money to sit near the poverty line. Many jobs even ask for me to work for six months to a year unpaid before considering me. (Sounds insane, I know, but I am sure many others my age will agree) I began to feel something different about the world. The world doesn’t seem as exciting as it did when I was a child. Or even the past year. Things seem gloomy for the future. Anyone that does not sit at the top is treated like a cog in the machine, and honestly, it is because we allow companies and those that lead us to treat us this way. In many ways, these companies are more like gods to us than our own religion. The way Apple, Amazon, Nestle, and the other six fucking companies left exist in this world is essential as overlords. They could not give less of a fuck about their consumers or employees, but they expect absolutely everything out of those that serve them. Both from employees and consumers alike. Amazon literally forces its employees to piss and shit in bottles to keep on schedule. Drug prices are so high that individuals have to give more than everything just to stay alive. It’s literally everything…


So naturally, I began thinking about politics and those that “run” our society and thought, I wonder why they haven’t done anything about this. These people that claim to care about us/our interests and run our cities are more concerned with their insider stock trades and getting reelected than they are with helping those that live within our districts. There are two parties left in this country, ten companies left, and everyone hates each other over the dumbest shit I have ever seen. Maybe it is just easier to control us this way. I'm not entirely sure. All I know is that we have become slaves to our own society, and we have no one to blame but ourselves. Everyone just seems to be angry and chasing a better life with absolutely no means of changing it. I know that things have always been this way, but I just wish they weren’t. I want to use my life to help change these things. There is just so much that's fucked up. I believe that until everyone wakes up to what is going on around us, we will be enslaved for the foreseeable future.

i chose to limit my availability because my boyfriend and i have made a point to set several winter weekends aside to spend time together and go on little trips. we live an hour away from each other, and due to the seasonal nature of both our jobs, we’ll have quite limited time together in the warmer months. 

anyway, i made sure to tell the boss up front, and he said that was fine, they were desperate for help. and yet, every time he makes a schedule, he bitches at me about not being available friday/saturday nights, tells me i’m making things really difficult for him. he has a bit of a temper, so i’m refraining from saying anything sassy, but i REALLY want to ask him, well would it be better for you if i quit? i’m sick of being made to feel guilty over things that are truly not my problem and could easily be solved by better management. besides, i know for a fact i’m the most reliable and efficient worker he has right now. sorry not sorry for prioritizing other aspects of my life over work, dude. figure it the fuck out.",quick rant: boss is shaming me for not having open availability.,29

I work in IT (I do everything from software engineering to coding, business analysis, release and project management etc) and I am really fed up of the job.

Not because It is hard or anything but I should not have to explain same things to the same people all the time, dealing with the people who are not technical but somehow managed to work in IT (working on the technical positions without being technical)  or the worst, people who are not open to learn new things and stick to the old ways of working as they used to (related with their job function). It's expected for me to deal with uncertainty all the time because business people don't know what they want. No matter how hard I try to seek alignment with them, It does not happen because "" business is not stable""

Some days I feel like, some people do exist to create work for IT to look good in their departments. My line manager is a "" yes man"" who only cares to cover his back and the rest is not important. As you can guess, he does not like disagreements with business so he tries to deliver everything he is being told blindly. I don't know how many times I was pulled in a meeting without me having anything to contribute to that meeting. (This is very common on corporate jobs I know) It makes me wasting my time utterly.

On the other hand, I just want to switch to non technical IT job because IT is the only thing I know and It pays well. I am seeking for positions right now to switch from technical job to non technical job by knowing more or less, I will experience the same things everywhere but I don't want to be primarily responsible to deliver and develop things. I want to be middle man / paper pusher to reduce my work related stress.  I am totally aware the fact that, personally I can't end work in the following 20 years but my solution would be having less stressful job and have less responsibilities.

I'm also black, which goes into my next paragraph.

Now, on my fourth day, I want to leave or at least make a few complaints. Tonight, for example, my supervisor referred to me as ""that other girl"" which rubbed me off the wrong way as she knows my name, and I was one of the three girls there (the others she knows their names by heart). If that wasn't enough, she called an Asian customer on Friday a ""Oriental Lady"", which also made me uncomfortable.

I also have to work closings every single shift. Now, I don't mind closing but every shift can be detrimental to me. I'm also a full-time college student, and some days I can work in the afternoon just fine since the location is super close to my school (it's completely doable). They also make me do really tough tasks all by myself (one shift, I had to prepare the fries and food all by myself for the rest of my night shift, and tonight I had to wash a shitton of dishes by myself, almost burning myself in the process due to the fact the water has to be really hot). I don't get proper breaks sometimes, as I'm ""closing"" according to my supervisor.

People are leaving this location by the day, which worries me, and I'm unsure of if I should stick around or not. I kinda don't want to go job searching, but I also don't want to be in an environment like this.

Also there’s only one working time clock in the building and it’s at least a 3 minute walk to get there, so even if you get there right at 5:57 or something you may end up clocking in at 6:01.

Point systems are kind of a hit or miss for me because yes you obviously don’t want people just showing up whenever, but I think if someone does a no call no show that’s grounds for a point. But if I call in way ahead of time or before the shifts starts, I think it’s wack to get a point for that. 

I know it’s different per job, but if the “supervisor who barely do anything but sit in their office the whole shift doesn’t have to actually clock in bc they make salary &amp; the point system doesn’t apply to them, then it shouldn’t apply for the people working for 15 hours making your product.","Point Systems, Grace Periods &amp; Absences *mini rant*",8

Now lets begin

---The minimum pay---
The lowest wage a person can have in croatia on a full time job is around 4500kn which is roughly 650 euro and the full time job in Croatia is ussualy 8 hours a day, everyday, most of the people who work are forced to use their ""free days"" when they are sick becouse the pay gets cut more then half if they are sick for more then half a month(since the pay of 650 euro isnt only from working hours, employees ussualy add warm meals and such to the final pay, and if the person is sick they dont need warm meals money provided by the country and other bullshit).... Lets take it even further, 2 days ago news were going around how companies dont want to pay disabled people full salary since they are disabled and cant work like normal people, and the sad fact is that the companies are winning.

----Cost of life----
Lets begin with housing, most of the apartments(small and poor ones) are extremly expensive, 150k€ for a small apartment while country minimum is around 2.4€ per hour... While if you want to rent a place consider 2/3 of your pay going to the apartment owner ussualy around 2500kn or 300€ per month.. Inflation has raised the prices of food and gas so high and it will get even higher since the country is transfering to euro soon.. like bro we gotta pay like 2€ for a normal bread and i wont even start on the meat prices... The fuel aka gas prices have risen up to around 12kn per liter or around 1.3€, in a country where most of the people live in far off villages or islands.. 

----taxes----
This will be one if the shortedt sections since taxes on food and everything is 25%... i dont even need to explain how big of a problem this is...

---about corruption---
for legal reasons this country isnt corrupt and there is no way people are going to prision for critisizing politicians, also I've never heard about people unable to build houses, open buisneses or get jobs becouse someone in a higher position dosent want them to succed. So there is no way Croatia has one if the most corrupt goverments.

----TLTR----
Croatia cost of living is so high that people with good playing jobs have a hard time living a normal life, most people where I live have to work two jobs just to keep the food in the table(one legal and one illegal ussualy).",General state of Croatia / / / rant,10

“What do you want to do when you grow up?”

It’s one of those generic, easy questions to ask a child. Something simple for them to answer, because from a young age we’re taught that the end goal of adulthood is work.

“What do you want to do when you grow up?”

A police officer. A doctor. A lawyer. Answers like this are the norm today, and were still the  norms in the days when I was a child.

How many times, however, have you heard a child answer along the lines of what follows:

“Well, I’d like to start the day by taking the time to grind by hand coffee beans for my morning coffee. Then, I would spend the next few hours, before the sun is too high in the sky, to tend to my garden, where I grow a variety of flowers, as well as some fresh vegetables. I’d spend the warmer part of the day indoors, creating art; writing, painting, and mixed media. As the evening rolls in, I take the vegetables that I grew in my garden to prepare dinner. I spend the night surrounded by the people I love, none of us too exhausted from the day to deter from deep and meaningful conversations.”

Despite my language being too flowery to be believably uttered by a 9 year old, there is a reason that even teenagers don’t give answers to this question that are steeped in culture and a sense of community.

For a majority of our most formative years, it is drilled forcibly into our minds that everything you do should eventually get you closer to making more money.

“Why do I have to do my homework?”

You do your homework, so that you can get good grades, so that you can progress through school, graduate with impressive merits, get into a good college so you can get a good job and make the most money that you can.

“Why do I have to go to college?”

Because people that don’t go to college work until the day they die at McDonalds. People that go to college make more money. (Something that hasn’t even been true for years.)

Basically any question a child asks their parents about why they have to do something is only a few degrees away from “so someday you can make the most money you can.”

Why?

That is a question that has sat in my craw for the better part of 15 years now, and something that still churns in my mind today.

When I was a kid, before I knew enough about the sickness of capitalism to care, there were several jobs that I had learned to covet. Forensic scientist. Graphic designer. Movie theater owner. But somewhere in my high school years, and into my brief time in college, a different kind of thinking began to creep in.

I thought about the things that interested me. Film, art, culture, nature, romance and writing. My love for these things has always been, and will always be. These aren’t all things that necessarily require a college education or huge sums of money to enjoy. Why would I want to spend the majority of my days, days that become years, toiling away doing something that I have no passion for, and derive little joy from? Why are we not allowed to partake in the things in life that bring us happiness, exclusively?

If you go to school and work every weekday for 60 years, with weekends off (a privilege that a majority of workers don’t necessarily have), if you do the math, you will spend, collectively, 43 years worth of time working, with a depressing 17 years of collective time being your free time. Why is that a ratio that we are just expected to accept? Not even half of our time on this earth is spent doing what we want. And the rest of that time belongs to a corporation. The thought of this makes my heart sink.

“That’s life! That’s just how the world works.” the Boomer and Gen X homeowners will scream at us from their ski resorts and summer cabins.

But ***WHY*** is that life? ***WHY*** is that the way the world works. **Who decided that for us?**

So, as I was just starting my journey in the adult world, and everyone was asking me what my plans were, and where I would go to school, and where I was going to work, I struggled to provide answers. The things I actually wanted to do were to learn how to cook, spend time with my significant other, enjoy films, and play with my pets. At the time, I knew there were a lot of stay-at-home parents and spouses, but these individuals often work even harder to maintain a home, and are thanked even less for their work.

But fast forward to now, early 2022, and the idea of anyone my age staying home is unfathomable. As wages have stagnated, the cost of living only continues to skyrocket. A quick Zillow search for my small town in the middle of New Jersey shows that the cheapest one bedroom apartment in my area is $1500 per month. I don’t think I’ve ever worked a job where I have made $1500 dollars in a month. Even as a couple both making the kind of money that I make splitting that price wouldn’t  leave almost any money on the table for food and other bills and recreation. It’s not realistic, and it isn’t sustainable in the long term.

As a person without a college education, and with no talents of note that I could monetize, most of my work has been in customer service. But even college educated people and healthcare workers can’t afford the current cost of living. Look at the situation in Ketchum, Idaho. The mayor there pitched the idea of opening a ***tent city*** in a local park to provide housing for local teachers, nurses, service industry workers, and other professionals. 

“There’s a bathroom in the park.” said Ketchum mayor Neil Bradshaw stated. “They could walk over to the YMCA to shower before work.” 

That is something the Ketchum mayor said with complete earnestness. Barely addressing a symptom, nonetheless the sickness.

The people who are caring for our loved ones in hospitals and children in our schools, during a pandemic, can’t afford to sleep inside. The city of Ketchum had made moves to build affordable housing units, but progress on that was halted because the uber rich in the area didn’t like the aesthetics of the proposed design of the building. Ketchum is a microcosm of what is happening all over the country right now. The disgustingly wealthy are staying wealthy, and only growing wealthier, and they are doing so by standing on the shoulders of the hourly worker. And they are doing everything they can to maintain that status quo.

I’m not an economist or a financial analyst or anything of the sort, but you don’t have to be to look at basic information and realize how oppressive the capitalist system in the United States is.

Let’s look at a list of the 12 most wealthy countries in the world, and their GDP per capita.

1. Luxembourg ($120,962 GDP per capita)
2. Singapore ($101,936 GDP per capita)
3. Qatar ($93,851 GDP per capita)
4. Ireland ($87, 212 GDP per capita)
5. Switzerland ($70,276 GDP per capita)
6. United Arab Emirates ($69,957 GDP per capita)
7. Norway ($67,978 GDP per capita)
8. United States ($65,278 GDP per capita)
9. Brunei ($64,725 GDP per capita)
10. San Marino ($61,006 GDP per capita)
11. Denmark ($60,334 GDP per capita)
12. Netherlands ($59,469 GDP per capita)

The homeless population in the United States as of 2020 was 580,466 which places it at number 28 on the list of countries with the most homeless. Denmark, a country 3 positions below the US as far as total wealth, has only 6,431 homeless as of 2019. Denmark also guarantees all workers in its country a guaranteed minimum of 25 days of paid vacation per year. In the US we are guaranteed 0 days of paid vacation. In Denmark, mothers and fathers of newborns are entitled to up to 46 weeks of maternity/paternity leave, and payment for that time is decided on collective labor agreements. In the US, mothers are only entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. If the US is wealthier than Denmark, why aren’t we enjoying these quality of life improvements also?

There is one stat in which the US handedly beats out Denmark, and that is the number of billionaires. The United States boasts 724 billionaires, where Denmark houses a measly 8.

It seems like there is a lot of wealth in America, so why are so many people homeless? Why can’t new parents spend more time with their newborns? Why do so many of us work jobs with no paid time-off, or only a handful of personal days per year? Why are our nurses and teachers potentially living in tents? Why is a less wealthy nation able to provide such an astronomically better quality of life to its citizens?

It comes down to the simple fact that the rich and powerful in the US do not care about us. They care only to maintain and grow their exorbitant, all consuming wealth and lavish lifestyles. They are deathly afraid of having anything lesser. The wealthy and the politicians are all in business together, and that business is to make sure we toil away forever for their growth, not our own personal growth. We are numbers and we are machines. These people are so far removed from my experience, and the experience of people like me. They have absolutely no idea what it means to live like us. And how can people that don’t know our experience make decisions that are supposed to improve our lives? Donald Trump doesn’t care about us. Joe Biden doesn’t care about us. Jeff Bezos doesn’t care about us. Elon Musk doesn’t care about us. They barely know that we exist.

One of the first anti-work pieces of literature I read was Paul Lafargue’s *The Right To Be Lazy*. In it, Lafargue ruminates on the failings of a capitalist society, as well as other social issues. “*Thus the forts of Paris and Lyons have not been built to defend the city against the foreigner, but to crush it in case of revolt*.” he says, a direct parallel to the police violence that Black Lives Matter protesters have been met with since the beginning of the movement.

This essay was written in **1883**. That’s a long time for a nation to leave a problem unaddressed that affects so many people. While disheartening in that aspect, it did fill me with a sense of belonging that other people have felt this way, and for a long time. But it goes back further than that.

The Greek philosopher Aristotle, who lived from 384 BC to 322 BC said, “*...that if every tool could by itself its proper function, as the masterpieces of Daedalus moved themselves or as the tripods of Vulcan set themselves spontaneously at their sacred work; if for example the shuttles of weavers did their own weaving, the foreman of the workshop would have no more need for helpers, nor the master of slaves.*”

Aristotle dreamed of automation, and the freedom that it could bring to the human race. All this in the 300’s BC.

And yet, at the first sight of automation in our jobs and in our factories, the wealthy and the corporations they run convinced you that something was being taken away from you. That you needed to fight for your “right to work.” And you won; you successfully earned your right to toil away in unfulfilling labor for the rest of your life, as opposed to letting an emotionless machine do it for you.

Congratulations. Thanks for that, it’s working out great.

While my ideal dream of a work-free utopia may be unrealistic, climate change will kill us all long before that could ever happen, we could be a little bit closer to it. Our country has the resources to better our quality of life. They just don’t. Other countries with less means are doing it, and have been doing it.Why not us?

Again, I’m not an expert on anything. I barely graduated high school, and dropped out of college. Part of this is based on data I found, but a majority of it is just from the heart. And my heart tells me that our lives are worth more, and should be full of more things that make us happy.","A Long, Stream of Consciousness Rant.",1

I watch as people who desperately are in need of loans or financial help get fucked by these greedy corporate pigs and denied help. I watch how people who have been working for this corporation for 20 to 30 years are still making less than 50k a year who can't afford to retire because they don't have enough. Just this year we were given a 2 percent raise as inflation rises to nearly 7 percent and probably over that. (I looked up how much the CEO earns and it’s well into the 8 nearly 9-digit mark). I watch as our severely understaffed branches get fucked because they don’t want to pay people more money to work for them. I have no love for these giant corporations where the top executives make tens of millions if not hundreds of millions if not BILLIONS OF DOLLARS while some of the hardest working people I know suffer.

How DARE these greedy corporate fucks take advantage of the people who work for them. I have no sympathy and will continue to do everything I can to be the laziest worker and fuck them over until I find something worthwhile. It's time they learn they can't take advantage of people.

Sorry for the rant but I am so SICK of watching the average person get fucked over while the elitist corporate pigs get everything and more.

Only to learn more and more how the cards are stacked against the average person to get ahead. It's so frustrating.

Restaurant work is the epitome of what capatlism has become. 

I've been working the service industry for years and I'm starting to transition out finally, albeit at a lower pay which is itself stressing me out.

But I've held on for so long because of that reason. Pay has always been better than most jobs and it's prevented me for moving on to something less stressful. Of course the whole other stress of slower times and hours being cut is a different story. Watching whatever savings you collected during the busy season depleting during the off season isn't much better.

After the last two years, I'm just so tired. The late nights and short staffs. Why is it all resturaunts are always short staffed? There's never the appropriate amount of staff for the given situation.  Doing three people's jobs all at once. Listening to owners blame ""lazy people"" for not being able to find staff in the current state 

There's also no real way to progress in the service industry, and thus no future. If you stay with the same place as a bartender for 5 years, you're most likely still going to be a bartender with the same pay (or worst because as places age their clinetele usually drops or platues). Speaking of clientele, they have become worst and more needy because of everything that's happened in the last few years.

But baaaaack to my original point. restauraunt work is basically this point and time's ""capatilist"" society wet dream. I'm using ""capatilist"" here because I don't have a better word. But if Jeff Bezoz could use the same labor tactics as a small resturaunt then he would. 

Restaurants are one of the few industries that can circumvent paying employees minimus wage as it is subsidized but their guests and guilted on to them to support the staff. We all know that by this point. Even in states where minimum wage is going to be rising to $15~ server wage is still trailing behind.

They do not offer any benefits and nobody bats an eye. I've never been offered health insurance, PTO, Sick Time or any of that stuff most industries would offer even at it's bare minimum. I don't even really get breaks. When I used to smoke I had one boss say to me, ""why should I give you a break just because you smoke? No one else is getting a break!"" Meaning he didn't want anyone to take any break. 

Yet I'm suppose to care like I'm some integral component of the business. In reality they could replace me in a days time (or just run short staffed as it goes). I'm supposed to put on this happy face like I'm not breaking my back for 10 hours straight. I'm suppose to be super human like I don't get tired after all that.

And after all's said and done, there's zero job security. Like I said I could be replaced in an instant of need be. The owners could fuck up their finances and have to shut the place down. And is that my fault? No. But do I see any kind of bail out from losing my job even though it's some one else's fault? Still no. 

That's what I got for you right now. I just needed to get that off my chest.",Rant from a ten year vet in the restaurant game,18

Much more than what I was originally working but this also means I can never get benefits. Not to mention my official position is ""trainer"" but nothing has actually changed in the system and nobody will acknowledge that I actually know what the fuck I am doing.

At this point, I am either going to just stick with this bullshit until I can take over my roommate's God awful internet speeds and reapply for a WFH job for a company I actually want to be a part of or apply to Trader Joe's since they actually pay way more and can guarantee me full-time.

The questions are important to me, but despite the way I wrote it obscuring said questions, I think it's more honest for how I wrote it.

Also, it was just really fucking cathartic.

Here it is:

  

Stream of consciousness is all I have left. I am rage and emptiness against the structures that bind me to a future of slavery in all but name. I see the world and the answers we’ve tried to replace the finality of capital as the representation of value.

Are their failures a reason to continue capital at the behest of those who won the game they forced us to play? I want to live in a world that is thoughtful about the structures and willing to change them for the sake of the people that live.

Imperfection as a constant means EVERYONE is wrong about something and will never know WHAT they’re wrong about until they face it. That does and MUST include your dearest held beliefs or no one will change.

Has anyone who assumes their righteousness changed you?

Has it ever been towards their way of being?

How are our strategies for communicating this any different?

I love this community for what it does in support of workers. I hate the feeling of futility that occurs whenever I think about the structures that we live in. I want CHANGE and while strikes are a useful ultimatum are they changing the people behind this who still have the money?

&amp;#x200B;

**Can we even know who among those in power do so in spite of knowing it's wrong?**

**Can we know that treating them like people won't help even in the face of our own dehumanization?** 

**I DON'T KNOW AND THIS ISN'T RHETORICAL, BUT I DON'T SEE IT ASKED, HOLY SHIT HELP PLEASE!**

&amp;#x200B;

Will we have this song and dance every century? Like mental health recovery, society puts structures into place that restrict the upper class and, once things go right, remove those restrictions because “we don’t need them anymore, look at how well we’re doing!” Ignoring the fact that the progress is sourced in the structure.

Typical panel style interview. 5 people there. 

Typical questioning back and forth, they then made jokes about the manager always being there. That he worked their for 30 years and practically lives there. That he is always watching. Asked me if i was willing to work 6 days a week asked me about my personal life if I can dedicate lots of time to work. Then it got to wages.

In my province an apprentices wage is based of the journeyman rate of said job. I stated the rate at previous jobs I worked at. 

The manager then stated that their journeyman rate fluctuates alot. He then goes on about how having done your schooling means nothing and goes on to rant about unions and how they protect the weak, and they have a good base journeyman rate doesn't motivate anyone to work hard and further their skills and that they should protect the weak. He then bashed municipal employees because where I live they are paid well and treated well. That they arnt allowed to do work unless they have a certification for it and that the city puts them through paid training before they expect them to do the work. How they employee a bunch of panzies and that no one there is really skilled or willing to work hard and he expects lots of over time exc. He ranted on for 5 minutes about this spewing off all kinds of shit. 

After his rant I ended the interview. Shook their hands and walked out.

Carried the kitchen with 4/14kitchen staff, despite being fucked on hours, maxed on production.

Eventually my owners and managers grew too old and incompetent to compete in the restaurant space. Carried them through the Pandemic, only to be taken advantage of many times over 11 years. Kept them open, got 2 days a week.

Started a new job 2020. Sushi chef de partis. Small kitchen/staff. Tedious, but easy enough. Start at X Minus -$1.50, promised growth, and performance review/raise potential every 3 months.

1 month in, just being the new guy. No big deal.

2-3 months in. Sous Chef/KM somehow reap every overtime hour available while contributing nothing. They break their contracts, told the owner ""fuck you and this job"" and left without notice. 

I have to start working basically both of their jobs to keep the place open. 60+ hours a week. I immediately told the owner ""I'm not going to be taken advantage of, I cant do 60 hour weeks and don't feel appreciated for keeping the business open""

Owner hits me with ""Oh no, we appreciate you, and we're increasing your pay to what you were being paid at your last job as Sous chef""

While still promised 3month performance reviews and raise potentials (I gladly accept guidance where to grow)  haven't had a performance review until I demanded one for myself AND the kids I trained to DO RECORD NUMBERS one week; I haven't received a performance review in like 7 months. 

Owner finally caves to a performance review. Reviews us all, with the new KM, and says we're all making great revenue, growth, numbers.
Yestersday. Gives us criticism we've already dealt with 5 months ago. Doesn't offer anyone any sort of raise, despite record profit, only out dated criticism. I'll stay hopeful and dedicated to a chef's cause.

Talk to a trainee and said ""They gave you a raise by my reccomend I hope!""

They say ""No, they told me I wouldn't receive one""

I ask ""Why????!!?!"" They state ""Oh, they said they already pay me Y (9% less than you) 

Today, my supervisor texted me before my scheduled shift, saying ""come in early, I gave your coworker off, so they don't hit overtime"" 


Uhhhhh, let me get this straight:  I TRAINED AND TAUGHT people for record breaking profit, taught them food safety laws, enforced said safety laws, gave 11 years fine dining cooking experience from fantastic chefs to your company...

Only to learn that the 19 year old kid I'm training is not only going to probably take my job, but also I'm only being fucking paid 9% more than them, while having 900% more experience and skill than they have?

I have a wife, pets, and a child on the way. And I'm training my futute competitors. For a fucking 9% pay difference more???



I'm totally fucking fed up with having greedy unregulated ""at will employment"" bosses fucking EVERYONE because of their incompetent business decisions. 


I'm looking at a food truck to buy next Sunday; also applied for 5 other salaried Sous Chef positions.

I'd rather risk my entire life on taking on investors for my own business venture, IN THIS ECONOMY, or try my best at a salary position, than lose a fucking cent of dignity to some bullshit narcissistic ""chef"" that promised and promises more than the fucking 8'of freezer space they can deliver; while my restaurant literally funds every other ""business venture/expense"" THEY can afford, like that new Lambo, to ""keep up appearances.""

All it does is make the hiring process harder than it needs to be, and it isn't usually as effective of an hiring strategy as they think.

How the hell can people without them get jobs then. Need I mention how incredibly antisocial it is to people who want to work but don't like talking the whole time?

Unless it's a job like healthwork or teaching, interviews are a waste of time because trying to know someone all at once is ridiculous, and thinking they can predict how someone will act is very shaky.

The issue of school debt, capitalism, anti work et al is just so big, it's hard to not tangle up all the moving parts.  To make myself feel better, I'm putting the pretty, organized version here:

1. Everyone should never have to worry about housing, food, healthcare, or education. Basically anything on the bottom of the pyramid of Maslow's heirarchy of needs. Make them free. 

2. Free means no conditions. Who are you to determine what someone else needs? Determining 'only these degrees get free education', or 'food stamps for only certain brands', or 'only these types of houses' is fucking bull. You don't know someone better than they do. 

3. Who cares if someone decides to not get a job after having those needs met? Like, honestly how does it effect you? If you're happier staying at home watching Netflix, all the power to you. If you prefer spending the day making sparkle starfishes with googly eyes, go for it!

4. Not every hobby has to be a side hustle or commercialized. The default to something you enjoy doing like knitting should not be ""can I sell this"". Just creating for the sake of creating should be enough. 

5. 16/17/18 year old should not be penalized with debt until the day they die for choosing the wrong degree. They say: 'you didn't have to go to school right away', 'could have taken time off'. But when all teachers, guidance counselors, etc. tell you how the only viable path is post secondary, you trust them. 

6. Paying more in interest than the initial loan amount should be illegal. 

7. The current system is not fair no matter how you look at it. To succeed you need a support system. Society as a whole is terrible for not stepping up to be that support system to all. 

8. Stop falling back on ""well, I had to do x"", ""I didn't get y"". So. Fucking. What. Is that not the purpose of life? To make things easier,/better for the next generation? You did not get maternity leave and it absolutely sucked. Why do you want to subjugate others to that fate?

9. Technology has increased so much. Productivity has increased so much. We, as a whole, should be rewarded for that with in turn with free time.

10. Asking who would do the shitty things if people weren't forced into to have basic needs met isn't a defense. People aren't productive just because of money. Mental well being ties into a sense of accomplishment and each individual has a unique definition for that. Someone might enjoy doing the thing you deem shitty. Also maybe, just maybe, if people weren't worried about food they could accomplish greater things. 

Just. I'm tired. I feel like it should be common sense to make sure we look after each other. Why does your worth only appear if you contribute something that can be sold?",Rant: A place to put my thoughts,7

I've been making reports about our trucks being unsafe to drive for months without any action taken by managers. The company policy is that our on site mechanics can't repair the rental trucks they have us driving, so the managers are supposed to call the rental company and have them make repairs. The issues is the managers never do it. I finally got fed up and called OSHA last week because HR wasn't taking any action on the matter and my coworkers kept driving trucks that had major issues like missing mirrors and having heavy metal ladders falling off the backs of the trucks. 

A coworker overheard me warning another driver not to drive the unsafe trucks because he would get fired if he was caught and told me all the same bullshit HR was regurgitating. I told her the managers had a duty to remove the keys from our pegboard so nobody would be able to drive them and she tried to blow me off, but I was adamant about how that's OSHA standard.

So that happened last week, and then a few mins ago she came to ramble to me about how the Vice President is supposed to be in town today. I made a lame joke about how she should sprinkle some money on our poor city (San Bernardino) which is literally falling apart. She got so mad! She started going off about how she doesn't want to pay higher taxes to help people who ""don't even try to help themselves."" I asked her what she thought about getting our roads fixed (they're full of potholes and everytime it rains entire streets become flooded and have to be closed off to traffic) or how there's a light pole that a car hit and knocked over that laid on the side of the road for weeks until the city came and removed it (it still hasn't been replaced). Like this city is in horrible shape.

She got really mad and went off about misallocated DMV funds, at which point I knew I was going to snap at her, so I told her she'd never convince me of her worldview and that I didn't want to discuss politics at work. She tried to argue but I turned my back on her and walked away while she was mid-sentence.

I'm currently unemployed since December. I started an interview process shortly before Xmas with a company who I think is doing really cool work and was really excited.

Over the course of about a month, I had an initial 1.5 hour interview, did an 8 hour assessment of my skill set (so a whole work day of unpaid labor), then was supposed to do a final 1 hour interview. At the last minute, they changed it to 2 final interviews of an hour each, 2 days apart. At this point I was wishing I had asked about the pay range beforehand, because was getting worried I was wasting my time. So before the 3rd interview, I asked if we could discuss the expected salary range to see if our expectations aligned before investing more time.

The hiring manager proceeded to get super defensive and condescending with me. He first told me they had a scale system of 1-10, but the salaries that corresponded with each scale ""depended on the person"". Then he changed to he's ""not allowed to tell me"". Then after I told him I felt it was unusual to not be willing to at least give a range they budgeted for the position, he gave me a super broad range that didn't mean anything.

I did the final 2 interviews with upper management, got good feedback from them..... only to get called a week later by the hiring manager to tell me they didn't select me because they ""weren't happy with the way I asked about the salary"" and that, despite me ""having more experience and requiring less training"", they ""had decided to go with a more junior applicant that was a better 'cultural' fit"",........

I was fuming. I don't think there's any possibly clearer way they could have said ""We chose someone more naive and desperate than you so that we could underpay them and not get asked difficult questions"" than if they had just said that. I'm both aghast that he had the balls to think he was invincible enough to just say that and scared for whatever poor person took this job and is probably going to get exploited and overworked for less than they deserve.....

HOW is it not required yet to just state the salary range in the job ad? I hate work, I hate capitalism, please when is Basic Income coming? Also F\*\*\* the phrase ""cultural fit"", it's just discrimination and exploitation.

Since I was 16 I’ve worked hard to get by, working 3 jobs while in high school and sacrificing my weekends and after school time. My life growing up was rough, filled with domestic abuse and medical issues; my father died without me knowing him, my mom’s subsequent husband was an abusive alcoholic, and I went through major medical trauma from the ages of 12-18 where I almost died resulting in two body casts, four years on crutches, six years of non-stop pain and a total hip replacement at 18 years old. I was told I will always need to carry health insurance, so “quality” work became an immediate concern.

After I graduated, I went directly into the workforce and worked in banking, eventually realizing I was getting paid garbage for what I was doing ($8/hr) and moving into bartending 40-50 hours a week for several years. At least I got cash tips, so using those funds I paid my way through college out of my own pocket.

I then decided bartending was not a career, and got into telecommunications. I worked in a call center for 3 years until I was so frustrated with the company I was with I couldn’t take it anymore and quit.

I then went to Sprint, as a sales rep, and was head hunted because I was “so spectacular” at how I helped a secret shopper for Verizon that they wanted to hire me. 

I worked for Verizon as a sales rep for a year until I made my way into management as long as I relocated. I moved two hours away from my family and friends with the promise that I would be able to transfer back in a year. The company changed the policy to two years before being transferable during this time, so I was then stuck two years. After my two years came up, there were no available positions in my home area, so I ended up staying there for four years instead. 

As I was beginning to feel comfortable in my new zip code, my previous boss took a promotion and a new boss came in that made my life a living hell. 

There was finally a lateral transfer position available in my home area, so I took it to get away. I ran the store there, with my boss relying on me to do his job and him taking the pay. I changed a sales team that had no motivation to do their job into a team that worked together and produced results, under my sole guidance. 

I was then asked to move several hours away with the promise to transfer over to my home town store when the manager, who was looking to transfer, left. “We will pay you to relocate and you will only be there for a year” they said. So I said sure.

This was in 2019; when 2020 came around and the pandemic happened I was completely alone thanks to this transfer. I had to play not only manager, but councilor and health advisor to my team of 9, as well as a remote team of 20 AND another store as because their manager didn’t have any leadership skills and left them all hanging. While doing this, I also ran multiple social media campaigns with the carrot of “this will get you out of retail” dangling in front of me.

I did this until 2021, when I applied to FIFTEEN different internal positions to try and get back to a place I felt comfortable living. The company had made so many changes that were counter-productive to my life, including demanding more responsibilities and providing less pay, I couldn’t handle it any more. Plus after three literal death threats from customers, I’d had enough.

Out of the 15 jobs I applied for, I had two interviews, both of which I nailed but they hired the person that was already in the district. Okay. Apparently the fact that each store I’d been involved with was in the top 1% in the company didn’t matter…

I told my boss “If I cant transfer back to ______ I’m going to quit” and gave them 6 months to make arrangements. I finally handed in my notice in April of ‘21 after being with the company for almost 10 years. I had no idea what I was going to do, but knew I wasn’t happy anymore and needed a change.

I moved back to my hometown, met my fiancé, and took over as manager and basically saved a local Veterans Club from going bankrupt. I let them know that I planned on doing this only temporarily.

Yet here I sit, working 60 hours a week helping this place out that would have died without me, having no dependable staff and looking back at my entire adult life wondering “why?”

I just want time; I just want to live and enjoy my life. I want to be able to experience life without feeling trapped. Why is it so hard to find something I can be passionate about that pays a living wage without dedicating my entire life to it? Am I just being a whiney bitch? I really don’t think so.

we have to try and upsell like multiple different things to customers in a transaction and most of the time it just leads to customers getting angry. i’ve even had customers ask if we get commission because we try so hard to sell it but the reality is if we don’t sell it, we could be fired. companies need to learn how to create good offers instead of forcing their employees to beg customers to buy them.

also what is it with shops and searching their staff? most shifts i end up leaving half an hour late because i have to wait for a manager to search me including my shoes, which usually results in me missing buses and having to wait an hour for a bus in the dark in an unsafe area.

a few weeks ago was my last straw. my shift started with my manager getting annoyed with me because i tried and couldn’t move deliveries taller than me and weighing probably 3x what i weigh down a hill without risk of injuring myself. i’m literally a teenage girl and pretty weak lol. they then indirectly accused me of allowing a shoplifter with a weapon to get away to the whole staff (i was literally struggling with those deliveries and nowhere near them at the time they stole) and then once again they wouldn’t help me with my holiday enquiries. the sad fact is that so many people have it worse than me and i just feel so hopeless at the way capitalism is ruining our lives",a retail rant,4

In their policy, they state I'm allowed to take my one hour unpaid lunch between 11 am to 1 pm. 

I like having an early lunch so as soon as 11 hits, I'm off to enjoy my one hour of me time. Not to mention, I work in a large office, so taking a later lunch means wasting a good 15 minutes waiting around for the microwave to be free, dealing with a bustling break room and making awkward conversations with coworkers I'd rather avoid.

Yesterday ( my official second week of working here) I was about to clock out for lunch when the CEO happened to be walking by. 

CEO: * Notices me clocking out* "" You aren't headed home are you?""

Me: Not at all, just popping off to lunch

CEO: Oh.. so early?

Me: yeah, I find the day goes by a little better when I take lunch earlier.

CEO: I see... 

He paused for a minute, seemed to ponder something and then just continued on his way. I thought nothing of it.

Today, he pulled me into his office at 10:50 and asked that I "" consider taking lunch at a later time""

Confused, but being polite, I asked if there was an issue with leaving at 11.

He explained that, by leaving at 11, I won't available to answer any questions about my work while I'm gone. He went on to say that he would prefer that I have lunch when everyone else does, that way I can be "" ready and available to answer questions when it is convinient for everyone else"".  He finished with, "" I understand there is a policy, but I would prefer that you take your lunch during a more convenient time""

I was trying to keep things polite, so I chuckled and said that "" it's only an hour, my work won't be going anywhere"". Immediately, his smile fell off his face.
"" If there comes a time when a project needs immediate attention and you are nowhere to be seen, I am going to be very disappointed"" he said.

At that point I doubled down. It's petty.. it's just lunch.. but he kind of ticked me off. I should snap back at the CEO during my second week but fuck it..

I explained that if he doesn't want me taking lunch at 11, the company handbook shouldn't state that I can leave at that time. I then explained that if he really wanted me to be available for help during my lunch hours, he should consider paying me during my lunch break. I mentioned I'd even be willing to take a paid half hour break instead, so that there's even more time for me to be available.

He kept his stern face and started a monologue  about how company policy is made so people don't take advantage of the company and how it's my second week so I shouldn't be pushing boundaries with policy when I stopped him, letting him know that it was 11 and that I had to be off to lunch. 

He was obviously pretty annoyed but he shut up and said "" see you at noon""

I got up and walked out.

So now I'm enjoying my lunch before I get back to what I imagine will be a stern talking to about taking lunch when I'm allowed to.","Small rant. I hate when company policy company "" preference"" differs.",22

**It's all rigged. Gerrymandering is built into the very fabric.**

hear me out: not just votes. not just the election. EVERYTHING.

We are all taught from a young age to blame everything on everyone else.

Supposedly ""the others"" are to blame for the tax laws. That they believe someday they will be rich so they vote against taxing the rich.

I think ""the others"" is a fabrication to keep us divided.

There are no ""the others"" be it Republican, Democrat, Independant, Multi-identity sheep person, we're all human, and we all seem to have a core set of values.

One of the values that seems to be shared by all groups except the stupidly wealthy and entitled: That everyone should pay their fair share for the common good, roads, schools etc.

So I'm pretty sure ""the others"" that are supposedly average Joe voting against tax increases on the wealthy are **just pretend votes purchased by the wealthy.**

I know I personally have never met someone who voted against taxing the rich. In fact, I've never even seen that as an option on any ballot anywhere.

I watched the Y2K bug fizzle, the .com boom and bust, the business effects of 9/11, several market crashes, every war since Gulf 1. I have watched the industry get flooded with sub-par foreign workers who guaranteed my wage would stagnate all while their work culture slipped in and turned my work into a sweat shop. I have been in un-paid, limitless, off hours on-call rotations most of this time, to the point I have PTSD from phones and beeping things. When I am not on-call, every device is silenced at all times. Currently, I am on-call every other week 24x7, where I am required to respond within 15 minutes to a page or my boss gets alerted. I basically can't plan to do anything outside of home during on-call times. I have been through every iteration and permutation of project management and work organization. I have seen on the job training go from instructor led, to sales team lead, to self lead, to meaningless exercise. I watch leaders take credit for my ideas and get promoted and I get censured for speaking up for myself. I have been fucked on stock options more than once and have watched my quality of life dwindle as my hopes of early retirement, or the slightest shred of stability or predictability in my industry, have faded into a jaded malaise. All of this while I watch the utility and functionality of technology drain away to be replaced by marketing gimmicks and meritless market share capture.

Don't get me wrong, I make great money, relative to the average American. I don't have debt. I have some savings. I have healthcare I can afford to use, barely, assuming I never actually get seriously ill. I still don't own a house and can't afford one. I still don't see a clear means of retirement. The typical financial instruments for retirement are shaky at best and the cost of living just keeps rising out of pace with my salary. And now we are entering a runway inflation period that no-one at work is talking about. I don't see an end to this.

My heart tells me to find something else to do but my brain tells me there is nothing else better. This is as good as it gets in America. I'd love to move overseas to Europe but, based on conversations with EU friends on-line, I don't see it being much better there and there's no simple way to immigrate anyway, unless you are already independently wealthy.

I have nothing but enmity for my past and present companies. I have pretended to be a good little employee for so long that I don't know what actually being a good employee even looks like anymore. I don't get the point of any of this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to be in this country anymore. I am not even sure about this planet...

They can claim that the flight benefits make up for lack of pay except for the non-mainline folks we get the worst benefits, still pay a large fee for some airlines, and we can’t even travel because it’s impossible to get time off since we are so severely short staffed.

Mainline employees are the ones who work directly under the airline, like that’s the name on their paycheck. Usually at hubs. Non-mainline are contracted out to folks like Unifi, which is the biggest airport employee contractor in North America. Usually them employees at the “smaller” airports.

Apologies for formatting, I'm on mobile. I did get my husbands permission to post this, of course. 

My husband worked at a franchise-owned domino's for 12 years. He was the assistant manager and was only making $14.25, working 35-45 hrs a week. For over a decade of loyalty, and he could count all the days he'd called in in one hand, including the day of his mother's death. Whereas I have always been a ""job-hopper"". He had no benefits, and the stores owner is a giant conservative with a gambling addiction and a history of being garbage with finances. 
The job was ruining his mental health, I watched him go from optimistic and easygoing to jaded and depressed over a period if seven years. I encouraged him to gtfo, so did his family, but he was pretty hesitant because he didn't want to get trapped in another job he would hate. 
He finally quit back in october of 2021. He did the 'right' thing and put in his two weeks and had a decent-ish-but-not-really job lined up. 
He starts the new job, is happier than I've seen him in years, excited to be moving into a hopefully better role. New job is with Geek Squad, making 16.25/HR to install appliances. This isn't what he wants perse, but he knows that with only food/customer svc experience, he probably can't jump straight into tech like he wants. I encourage this, as its a sensible start and the hiring manager of new job says that after a few months he might be able to move departments. 
 Little did we know that he'd get screwed into moving fridges that weighed up to three times his body weight and they weren't even allowed to use dollies BECAUSE THEY COULD SCRATCH THE CUSTOMERS FLOORS. (I'm still mad about it) For reference here, my husband is on the smaller side and has asthma. He had been assured he wouldn't be moving any of the larger stuff upon his hiring so he accepted the job under that pretense.
 So two weeks of this, his coworkers literally shoving all of the hardest jobs off on him because the manager works off-site an hr away and husband comes home covered in bruises, distraught, and in horrible pain feeling like a failure even though he did everything he was 'supposed to do'. 
This time he quits with no notice and no backup as he had no choice unless he wants to end up hospitalized and we havent been able to afford any kind of health insurance for four years now. When I tell you my husband was wrecked after this I do mean wrecked. The shoulder pain still hasn't completely gone away. 
 Now has two jobs, neither of which are paying him jack or scheduling him much at all- he's had both jobs since early november and one of them has scheduled him all of 8 total days in that time, even with three people quitting since he started. We were naive and thought that his work ethic, drive and experience would mean something but it doesnt. Everywhere is ""hiring"" but nowhere will even respond to his aplications.

These leeches infect a lot of groups made for wedding photographers/second shooters. Here's just the most recent one I've seen.

 

&gt;Hello all! We are looking for an *experienced*  wedding photographer to join our Oregon team! It would be a freelance  position. Must have plenty of Saturday availability for 2022. We have  125+ weddings booked, so there is plenty of opportunity.

\-- No editing

\-- Pay is $75 to $100 per hour

Would love to hear from you!""

On the company's website they advertise that wedding coverage, we can assume 6 hours, starts at $1500

That's $450 for the guy who actually takes the photos. Assuming they like the photog he's probably getting 1.5 jobs per week because most happen on Saturday. Weddings are seasonal so that's at least 18 weeks off per year around here. So for all that commitment our photographer is now making $23,000 a year, half of which will go to keeping your gear up to date, gas and other travel, etc. Go get some minimum wage job or shoot real estate to pay the bills I guess.

Plus now we've gotta pay for an office for a photo editor to sit in and all that, when the guy who was doing it himself would have just done it at home.

This is also terrible for the customer because now instead of finding someone you like who and being able to choose based on style, you're basically getting some weird mix of vision from the photog, the editor, and the CEO. Something bland. I've seen the photos and they're what you'd expect, \*corporate\* and designed to not disappoint.

Here's the best part though, you the photographer who is already working \*\*as a contractor\*\* don't even have copyright on your own photos, which is the industry norm and has been for centuries.

&gt;  **Images for your portfolio.** You'll receive a license to use the  images you captured at the end of the season. You can use the images on  your personal or business portfolio. The license is conditional on  completing all your assignments during the course of the season. 

Oh and of course, fuck you show up 10 minutes early and work for free. 

&gt;**Arrive early.** You'll be expected to arrive at least 10 minutes  early to every shoot. We use an online check-in process using a mobile  website.

After all is said and done and they've paid the photo editor the 30k per year average they make nation wide, they're probably taking home $900 of your $1500. And for fucking what? Advertising? Basically being your agent. What a joke. They'll probably get a lot of new unexperienced photographers and pay them poverty wages to produce decent photos but those people should be doing their own edits, their own advertising, and taking home a living wage.",Just a little rant about how the wealth extractors are trying to turn photographers into 0-hour contractors now.,14

Apparently our store has a sign up percentage of below 1% when it should be at 3%. Honestly this should have been in the job description because as I am always on the cash register, it is half my job to get them to sign up right there at checkout. (Other associates in the store are supposed to get them to sign up too but they don’t try or have much success I think.) There have been weekly reminders, goals, competitions, etc. me include everyone tallying the amount of sign ups that get but we never meet our goals. Initially the idea of a competition encouraged me because the person with the most sign ups would get a visa gift card (I just found out that it was only if the store reached its goal, which we never did). I was already getting sign ups but then I started to try to get even more and of course I just stopped trying as hard when i never heard of anyone getting gift cards after a couple months. 

Especially during the holidays we were just too busy and it was too hard to first convince people to sign up, and then talk them through the process on their phones and troubleshooting the technology if it doesn’t work. And sometimes whether it’s the fault of the phone, the provider, or the rewards system, if we can’t get the coupon the customer is annoyed because they were promised a coupon that they now can’t get.

 Actually, yesterday my manager was helping me with this and we found that a customer’s phone carrier did not allow her to receive these sorts of texts that the rewards program sends. I stood with the customer and my manager with the customer talking to her provider so she could get a 15% discount on her purchase. After all this was over the manager made it clear that she expects me to do this in any similar future situations. I just feel that my pay rate of $11/hr is not worth it.

Now we have a new manager and she is pushing this even more. Yesterday she talked to me about it and told me specifically what to say to the customers. I have to ask each person to check for coupons by scanning a QR code or sending a text. It takes a minute for people who are not super handy with technology. Yes I am happy to help people save money but I wish that there was an easier way to do this (such as having the coupons saved on the register system like most stores!). At least it gives me something to challenge myself with during work; I do like to see how many sign ups I can get as I am a competitive person. Yesterday I got 9 out of our goal of 13. But I only work 15 hours a week and if I work hard quite no one else does what does it matter

I missed a couple of days because of a fever and was told to not get a test because it would mean I'd be out longer and I had to go back to work ASAP so that we could go back to regular hours. Not the exact words of the store manager, but definitely what he meant.

I have one new person who, thankfully, had experience when they were hired and has been willing to work extra hours because he likes the money and is super chill about everything. He's the most mentally stable of us all lol. I haven't left because I need the insurance coverage and I get discount on groceries since I work there. I've been told multiple times that as the manager I need to step up and do more because it's what my job position says, but I don't care anymore. Today was my first day back after being out for a much deserved 4 day weekend (I wasn't allowed to use my vacation weeks due to staffing) and then the fever after. I was expected to work my whole 8 hours alone, stay later so that I could get mid things done for the new guy, put up the order that was in the back for a few days because nobody could come in, and set up our shelves because district people were coming in.

I make like $3 more than what cashiers are being hired for now because Kroger would rather hire people for more to replace those that leave than pay their current employees more to stay. I do way more work than scan groceries and clean around the checkout lines, but barely get compensated for it. They classify Starbucks as a sub-department so we're under deli, meaning that I'm not even a manager, I'm just a glorified, stressed out coffee maker.

Our union rep came in today and asked how things were and I was brutally honest about how shit things are. His advice was to double down on not doing more work by closing early and making them deal with it because they can't force any of us to work more than we're scheduled. Other stores are closing at 11am, we shouldn't have to be open regular hours in these conditions. It's about what we've been doing, but we look out for each other. We don't want to leave the next shift with nothing so we work harder because only the 4 of us will. One of the brothers put in his 2 weeks, and I imagine the other will soon, too, as he's been talking about wanting to work somewhere else and I don't blame him at all.

I've had the ""You'll get promoted soon"" talk so many times with the store manager but we're so short staffed that I can't even leave the department, let alone move up in the company. The lead before me was stuck for 2 years before she finally stepped down and changed locations, which only happened because I was able to step in. I'm demanding a raise soon, and if this doesn't change within the next couple of months, I plan on quitting and reapplying for overnight stocking or finding another job entirely. Insurance, my regulars, and my team are the main reasons why I haven't left. 

I'm the only one working right now because childcare is too expensive and my mom can't get a stable job around a schedule that is so flimsy, so leaving without a job set up isn't an option. Part of my leaving problem is that I enjoy working here, making people smile makes me happy, and my store is a 20 minute walk away. I love leaving little notes on the bottoms of cups so that a customer can get a silly, fun interaction later in the day. I often make little doodles on kid's drinks. I genuinely enjoyed my job, but all of this ruined how much I care. Customers started annoying me in the last few months because they're just something else I have to deal with, and I hate it. Part of me wants to go to a corporate store, but the bonus of having cheaper groceries is helpful. I've thought about doing both, but since I'm the manager I can't work less at my current job and I can't handle more hours or be on time with how things are.

Like I said in the title, this is mostly just a rant because I feel stuck where I am and I'm sad about my friend leaving soon, which is making me mad at the system even more than usual since the main reason for him leaving is the way management has been treating us. Finding this feed was really helpful, reading stories about people moving on to better things after being in shitty situations and people getting to stick it to the man. I'm holding out for the right time, hopefully it'll be soon.","Work Rant. Kind of long, I have no control",8

They severely underpay me, undermine me for my age (I'm 23 and everyone else in the office is above the age of 40), and just have the most backhanded attitudes exclusively towards me. For context: I am a graphic designer for a Publication agency that is ""family-run."" and has clients that span across Western NY.

I work in the office (even after I asked to work from home since I have an immuno-compromised roommate) every day and handle workloads on a day-to-day basis. I'm the only one that comes in every day, all three of my supervisors show up on Friday for about 4 hours but told me I can't work from home because they want to promote a ""family"" within the office... the REAL reason is they don't pay for our Adobe Suite (I'm using another coworker's) or a computer for me to use. 

Recently the one person who I get along with decided to move to North Carolina and instead of hiring someone else for the position (social media coordinator) they found out that I had experience doing social media and ""promoted"" me to that role. Mind you, the girl who currently does the position worked part-time for 30 hours a week, I work 37.5 hours and am considered full-time, and they want me to take on her responsibilities and get it done in 5 hours per week. 

ON TOP OF THAT: I do freelance on the side (to make up for the shitty wages they pay me) and my supervisor found my LinkedIn and Twitter and told me ""maybe reign in the design services a bit for yourself and direct them to us. You want to promote the place you work rather than doing it individually."" ... I was disgusted and told them that it was unprofessional for them to ask me that but took the social media position because of the pay raise and I plan on leaving this job very soon, might as well take the pay raise, use the rest of my PTO, and then bounce. 

Simple. I can do a couple of weeks of social media work, add it to my resume, and then fuck off.

I mean my assistant creative director took 2 days off every week in the summer and then just got back from a two-week vacation now totaling up to 45 days taken off, so it shouldn't be a problem that I take off ONE DAY for a medical procedure. 

Nope. 

I sent in my request explaining that I had the procedure that was scheduled for next Wednesday at 11 am and that I would need the day off. Also, I have a prelim appointment the day before that I said I could leave and come back to work after.

My supervisor called. (They will be italicized, I will be bolded)

*""So yea you can have those days off but you plan on coming in on Wednesday right?""* 

**""No, I asked for the whole day off because I have to get ready and get to the appointment early. Also, the location where it's happening is kinda far so it wouldn't make sense for me to come in because I would only be there for about an hour.""**

*""Well... We can give you it off but I talked to the Assistant Creative Director (a woman who has 45 days under her belt) and she said we're too busy to give you the full day off and if the procedure doesn't take all day you can come in after! Tuesday will be ok if you miss it as well but if you have to go to the appointment you need to come in 30 mins early every other day and make up the hours you'll miss somewhere else.""*

I was frustrated at this point.

**""\[Name Redacted\], I don't understand why I can't take the full day off Wednesday. It would considerably add more to my commute to the doctor's office and I'd only be here for an hour. I don't know what I could even do in 1 hour that would be productive. Also, I will be drugged up after the procedure so I don't think it would be wise for me to get behind the wheel.""**

*""Ok well just come in for that hour on Wednesday just because we may have work for you. It might be quiet but better safe than sorry.""*

**""Ok. I won't be coming in after though, I just want to make that abundantly clear.""** (I have given up at this point)

*""Just call me when you're done if you feel better after try to come in.""*

**""... ok.""** I hung up.

If you understood that I run into these idiotic discussions with them all the time you would know why I just gave up instead of fighting back. The people I work for are not necessarily evil-natured, they just cover their intentions with smiles and ""family togetherness"" in the workplace. Like my supervisor deadass told me to stop my freelance side business to drive more traffic to them, not realizing the reason I do freelance is because they don't pay me enough, BUT he did it with a smile...  

Regardless I've been applying to so many other places just to get out of this hell hole, and some of the time off I took is going to be used for interviews and taking care of that business. I needed to put this shit somewhere and rant about them because, in my head, I need validation that I'm not crazy or taking things too intensely to heart.

People's salaries are all over the board. People in very similar positions for my company make from 40-90k. They constantly lie about there being a cap on salaries for different positions, that the company has money troubles, etc. I started at 65k which I thought was good until I realized people in similar positions (sometimes with lesser degrees) were making 80-90. And someone who took over my old position (then 70k) was pressured into taking 40k (i really wish i had been able to warn her). Another employee was pressured into a position for 55k, when she knew the former employee was making 94k. We're also all told NOT to share our salary with anyone else. It was even written in my last offer letter.

""What is your disability."" Well to put it in simplistic terms. I have high-functioning autism and a bit of a speech impediment. For lack of a better explanation, it means I'm socially awkward and prone to not understanding some social situations here and there, but no way am I unable to live on my own or act like a normal person.  


A long while ago I got recommended for a job as a mechanic while I'm doing night classes. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the person who recommended me also had mentioned that I'm a little autistic. I didn't know this, nor did I plan on telling my previous employer because it's personal and often when people find out, they treat you like an entirely different person half the time. \[I've seen it happen time and time again.\]  


When covid hit I lost a lot of moved back home to go to classes for a trade and get a job to work while doing so. Towards the end of it I found out that my co-workers were hired on the spot with no experience for about 1.5x I was getting my first day. While going to classes for that field. I would work the same hours as them \[9-5 on weekdays, but some days we'd stay later depending on how things go.\]  


Some things happened including my boss pressuring me to let him use my family's property for personal projects which I would constantly put off and tell them ""We currently don't let anyone on the property due to covid and my father's deteriorating health and autoimmune disease, covid would be lethal for him and it wasn't worth the risk. This also wasn't a lie, but truth. Despite the fact he had been asking since the first week I worked there give or take, and kept on pushing for months and months.  


This man wasn't a family friend, but was a friend of a family friend so I didn't press or cause any trouble because I didn't want to cause any problems in a relationship when I was just happy to have a job that would give me more experience in the field.  


Well towards the end of my time there, I found out my co-worker was getting paid a lot more than me despite having never worked in anything but fast food and having no school or college experience along with mechanics. I laughed it off at first and asked if he was a family friend in which he said no. They always seemed chill together so I never really thought much of it.  


I ended up talking to him about it for a while and he let it slip that the reason he's getting paid more is because he's trusted to do more important stuff than me and I asked why. He had only worked there a month longer than I had. He realized I didn't know and flat out mentioned that it was because I'm autistic and my boss doesn't want customers knowing someone like me would be servicing their machinery and cars instead of someone more normal.  


I ended up laughing it off at the time but during break I pretty much broke down because it felt hurtful that it was all I was seen as after working there for 6 months without any problems really. I had always been nice to them, I never wasted time or stayed on break late. I would happily stay late when needed.   


After that I basically ended up struggling in figuring out what to do. I wanted nothing more than to stay at the job, but it hurt knowing that they all knew that and didn't have a problem with seeing my as not as worthy of working on things because of a label that had never affected me before doing my job. I had always kept it to myself because people treat me different and kind of start acting like I'm unable to comprehend things when in reality it just means sometimes things don't click with me socially right away here and there among other things.  


I had always thought of myself as part of the team and on good terms with all my coworkers but after that it started to feel more like pity they had on me. I ended up finding out later that it was my family friend who mentioned it, as he assumed I would tell my employer about it because it was pretty important.  


I didn't stay long after that, because I just felt that I couldn't. I had been doing things my co-worker has besides one or two things here or there, but I was getting paid minimum wage and barely affording class and food and rent.  


At this point it just feels like hell because no one tends to see past that part of me. And whenever a job finds out suddenly I'm not trusted to do things I used to be, or I end up getting let go a week or two later after I casually mention it to a co-worker I had become pretty chill with because they asked a question or two and I felt like I trusted them enough to be sincere about it \[A thing I had stopped doing before my current job\]  


I know it's not as bad as some of the other things that happen on this sub that people go through, but fuck if it doesn't hurt.

I was the lowest paid employee there at 22 and objectively worked 2-3x as fast with consistently higher quality and in more dangerous and tricky areas (roof work, ladder work) than the worse half of my teammates, who all made more.

--If they were better or more experienced then I'd accept the pay gap, but I was easily competitive with the senior workers and had specialised training and certifications for the field when nobody else did 


I was chastised for asking for a raise. I ended up discussing pay with my coworkers, causing half of them to quit and we all collectively sent complaint forms in to the labor board since the company was breaking the averaging agreement contacts we signed and refused to show us the paperwork when requested. They used this agreement to escape paying us overtime, but conveniently ignored upholding their end promising full time work - some months were under 20 hours, definitely not enough to cover bills. 


The company went through a ""voluntary internal review"" because we all submitted our complaint forms and we got the overtime pay at Christmas 



Additionally to all this, one of my managers routinely put me in unsafe environments (32ft ladder on my first week of work, unsafely set up (way too steep) before I was comfortable with ladders, and left me alone at the far side of the house with only 1 other person who was incapable of hearing me or helping with the ladder due to a physical disability) as well as pulling shit like making me do work without pay (cleaning a coworkers mess after the shift) or severely underpaid (offering 2 hours of pay for an 8 hour job). 

For contrast on the ladder safety, the good boss and team I had later had standing, albeit unspoken, expectations that any ladder over 24ft would be assisted unless explicitly not required and nobody was out of earshot while on them. She also budgeted extra time for ladder placements on difficult areas so workers didn't lose pay by being safe 

A different manager took extreme offence and thought that I was undermining her authority because I dared innovate, ask questions and determine such better solutions for problems than she could, that my coworkers started asking my advice over hers

It was my first corporate role because I graduated from college when the pandemic started in 2020 so finding a job was difficult. I saw a job posting for this job to work for a medium sized YouTube channel that is under the umbrella of a larger sized technology company. In the job posting, it stated that the candidate didn’t need to have experience and that training will be provided. I went through 3 rounds of interviews against 50 other people and I got the job. The first month on the job I was trained by a past YouTube consultant for the channel that no longer worked for the company (he lives in a different province so they wanted someone to work in office). After my training he gave me high praises and told the owner that I was a great hire. Working for this company had a very start up feel but I didn’t mind because I was working hard and learning everyday since the content the channel was focused on was new to me. I was managing the YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, &amp; Tiktok. I was putting in a LOT of work. 

Fast forward to the day after Christmas, I was exposed to covid and tested positive. I was super super sick. My supervisor (separate from the owner), messaged me my second day off asking me to come up with ideas for videos and I’m like, I’m literally sick in bed I can’t do anything. Anyways, I isolated for 10 days and told them that I would be able to come back last week Thursday. They requested that I do another test before I come back. So I did the test and the results came back inconclusive on the Saturday so I had to redo it on the Sunday. I informed my supervisor of this and explained that the nurse told me as long I complete my isolation im good to go back to work. She told me she would forward the message to the owner. She messaged me at 10PM Sunday night asking me to come in 8am Monday. I was already in bed and informed her of that on Monday but I would be back in Tuesday. She said okay but continued to ask me to come up with ideas to send them. I’m like I’ve been off for two weeks and have a lot of catching up to do so it would be more efficient for me to do it when I come in Tuesday morning. 

Went into work on Tuesday (my first day back after having covid), the owner and the supervisor call me into a meeting. The owner proceeds to tell me that I didn’t do any work while I was off for two weeks. I’m like I was sick. He’s like “(insert coworker name) is off sick now and she’s doing work at home”. I tell him I don’t know what level of sickness she has but I was very sick. He continues to tell me that he refuses to believe I maintained the same level of sickness for two weeks and that I refused to do work from home yesterday. He asks me how they’re supposed to take that attitude. I tell him that I don’t believe what happened yesterday reflects the type of attitude I have and the work ethic I’ve had since starting here. He tells me that I have a lot of work to do and to get on it. 

Anyways I work my WHOLE shift catching up on everything and getting things organized for the rest of January. My shift finishes at 4pm, and they call me into another meeting at 3:45PM. The owner sits in the corner on his phone while the supervisor proceeds to tell me that I’m terminated effective immediately. She tells me that they had different expectations and that it’s not personal it’s just business. She says the skills I have are better suited in a more structured environment. She says “we want to make it clear that we aren’t letting you go because you were off sick for two weeks. It would’ve been an earlier conversation but you were off and as you know your probation was up last week”. I’m in shock and I tell her that I’m blind sided by this because all I’ve done was work hard since being there. I explained that I applied to this role because it said no experience needed and I’ve been very open and willing to learn. (I’m crying during this because I cry when I’m angry unfortunately). 

But I wish them the best of luck and the only thing the owner said the entire time was thank you. Mind you I’m super confused because I helped them gain an extra almost 30k subscribers since being there. She says she has to escort me out as I collect my belongings and I’m super embarrassed because I felt like some criminal. As she leads me to the door she starts crying and telling me that it wasn’t her decision and that she wished me the best of luck. Then I left. My family members told me to contact them to get an official termination letter (I’ve never been fired before and I was distraught). So I emailed her this morning and she told me the HR lady will send me that document. 

My family was saying that I could possibly contact the labour board depending on what is outlined in the letter. But yeah I just feel numb and in shock because since my probation just finished I was about to get a raise and benefits. Anyways thank you for reading my rant :(",I was fired yesterday. (Rant),9

I just wanted to shout out to the small retail workers.
I work at a local retail store and started around 6 months ago, throughout this time the manager(and assistant manager) have been gone for an hour plus during my shifts (multiple times) and leave myself alone on the shop floor in silence.
As soon as the music turns off you know they are on their phone because their phone is connected to the music.
To be left on the floor with nobody but yourself in silence is such bullshit when you know there is two of them in the office for an hour plus at a time, please keep in mind I cannot leave the shop floor to get the customers goods unless someone else is there..

When did management get so goddamn lazy?
One of them had the audacity to come up and say ‘gee this is quiet’ and leave 30 seconds later.

At this point, it doesn't matter where you work at. It doesn't matter who you work for. It doesn't matter if it is a small mom and pop shop, or a multi-billion corporation. IF YOU ARE A WORKER, YOU ARE FUCKED. The objective of any businesses is to turn a profit (Economy 101, I know, whatever). In a country that sees the production of capital as it's main objective of rather than the welfare of its' constituents, employers and businesses will be allowed to get away with literal murder in cases of obvious negligence. They will be allowed to pay you peanut shells while they get the whole grocery store for YOUR work and they get to reap the benefits because they lucked out with a good employee like you, that's putting all you fucking can in your job despite living in one of the most dangerous times for your health and your labor being worth leagues above what you are being paid. Yet, can you afford rent? By yourself? Can you afford an emergency? Your car breaking down? Can you afford to take time off to go to the doctor and get that cough or weird lump checked? Specially when you are working overtime and can barely even sleep? You can't, but your employer does and your employer can. Yet, at a whim, when it suits them, they will do anything in their power short of firing you or reprimanding you, to get you to work more. Fuck that. We are people, not machines. We need work to thrive, not to survive.

Now that I'm done with my rant I want to get it out of my chest because I feel like I'm going insane, due to sheer rage and the red proletariat blood being pumped faster in my veins by the tentacles of capitalist exploiters. I work for a company that handles traffic violations. We were just informed that the business is doing great! All the hard work me and my coworkers put into the company is bearing fruit, and as a consequence,  we are expanding. What does this mean for me and my coworkers? More work and a shit ton of responsibilities. But does it mean more pay for us? FUCK THE HELL NO! You already knew the answer. Don't pretend like that wasn't a loaded question I threw in there so I can rage, and find some fucking solace in this dystopic, late stage, capitalist shithole of a country. (Yes I do live in the US, how could you tell?). And before you say, mom and pop businesses wouldn't do this, they know all their employees and they're like family - nah, bullshit. They pull the same penny-pinching, immoral and borderline illegal tactics that any other big company does. I feel like my labor in the company has taken a significantly high drop in value due to our company increasing our workload but not our pay. And all they had to say to us was thank you for your hard work. Fuck. All. Employers. You, your life, your dreams, your friends and family are worth more than any job you can get.

Needless to say I'm looking for another job, I want to negotiate an pay rise but at this point the amount of ire this job has caused me, along with their practices, to not give a single fuck about anything or anyone in that company. The moment I get word back from any of those other jobs, I'm calling in sick, I'm gonna cash in on my PTO and I'm leaving. And you bet your ass I'm not mincing words when I'm asked why I want to leave.

And yes, I am aware that I could ""just leave"" the job if I don't like it. I am seriously doing that. I have job interviews lined up this week (non-teaching) I want out. Like, seriously, out.   


I'm in my twenties, only been teaching for coming up seven years, so it's not like I've dedicated a lifetime to the profession. I wouldn't last a lifetime, anyway. I have always had, and always will have mad respect for people who are educators, no matter the level. No matter if it's nursery or early childhood, right through to high school or special education. Teachers do an amazing job, but it's such demoralizing work. I am a huge advocate for education. I love learning, and I'm an advocate for people learning new skills no matter their age or existing skill level, whether it's for a fun hobby or interest, or something more serious for a career. Learning is so important. Education is so important, but the system is going to collapse.   


Schools are run like businesses. Money is put first, over the needs of the children and students. People are purposely put in ""higher up"" positions and they do not have teaching experience or even a background in education. They're there to make more money. I understand that schools and education facilities need money to operate, however, for the last seven years of my job, I have heard nothing but, ""there's no money in the budget,"" or ""we cannot do that, we do not have the funds."" Where does the money go? One school, didn't even have baking soda or vinegar to make a volcano. A fucking volcano in the sandpit could not be done for the children, because there was no baking soda or vinegar. There are no resources. How are we supposed to do our jobs if we have nothing to teach with? How are children supposed to learn? It has just become the norm that teachers will buy supplies for the classroom with their own money. It's expected now, that teachers will go out and buy resources with their own paycheques.  I have heard so many stories and rumors of people in suits, or higher-ups somewhere along the line, skimming money off the top. My old boss was caught doing that. Now, they may just be rumors, but I've heard it too many times to put it down to just speculation or silly little stories. I've heard too much to believe it's false. If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, but it has at least happened in the past.   


We are treated like babysitters. I've even been called that, and not just once either. ""What would you know, you're a teacher."" I'll be the first to admit I don't know everything, I am on as much of a learning journey as the children, but when parents sneer at you, or treat you like shit and act entitled, because how dare I ask their little darling to stop doing something harmful, it hurts. And when the school board doesn't even back their staff up and pander to the parents instead to keep them happy, it hurts even more. All the unpaid over time, or extra work that is done outside of school hours, and not even a thank you, or a sign of some appreciation from the school board, or the people in suits. For the Christmas party, the higher-ups were taken to a very expensive local winery with a bar tab that was rumored to be in the thousands. The staff at school? We got bread rolls and ham in the teacher's lounge. Free food is free food, believe me, I am not one to turn my nose up at a shared lunch or free meal, but that one stung. The suits got drunk on ""company money"" so to speak, and the underlings and minions were given bread and meat. Undervalued, I feel undervalued. I've felt undervalued for the last couple of years. The board doesn't care.   


All I ever hear about in the papers or on TV is a shortage of teachers. Teachers are leaving. They complain about a lack of teachers and educators, yet nothing is being done to solve the issues or go to the root of the problem. Workplace culture is toxic, teachers feel undervalued and worthless, there are no supplies or resources. Teachers have to work two, sometimes even three jobs to make ends meet or pay the bills. We're treated like babysitters. Something has to give, otherwise, it's going to collapse.   


This is just the tip of the iceberg, no doubt I'd have forgotten something else I wanted to add, but I want out. And I plan on it. Again, I am a huge advocate for people learning. Anybody can learn. Learning is so important. But the children and students are losing out. There are no winners, here. The children and students will suffer. It's not their fault, either. I like children, I enjoyed my job for a long time, but my mental health cannot go on like this. The children deserve better.",I want to leave teaching *a rant*,14

I live in an African country so labour laws and the like are pretty much nonexistent here. 

I worked at a ~fancy~ pastry shop with a friend of mine a while back, I was on the morning shift and him on the evening shift (I worked 8am to 4pm and him from 12pm to 8pm so we did half a shift together) it started off pretty good we had 3 employees besides me on the morning shift and I was excited learning the ropes and whatnot. 

About two weeks in two people from my shift just quit, another 3 people from the evening shift quit as well some time after that (they had more employees since they get more clients in the evening). 

So in the span of 15 days we went from having 10 employees to 5 with two very fresh rookies in the roster. I was told that help would be hired very soon and just keep at it but it never did, which means that whenever my shift buddy took his one day off I would be left alone to run the whole store by myself for 4 hours, that means setting up the croissants and brioches, putting the cakes on display, setting up the pastry in their respective display fridge and making it look ""pretty"", restocking the drinks in the fridge all while serving costumers and keeping the tables and displays clean. You can see that this amount of work is way more than what two people can handle let alone one person. I did a very decent job and even got praised for how fast I picked up different aspects of the job. Also I should mention that there were NO lunch breaks and no chairs in the whole store. You had to go in the storage room, pick a spot on the floor or sit on a bag of flour or walnuts. And eat your sandwich quickly before the manager finds out you left your spot. It was no big deal when there were other people to cover for you while you took turns eating lunch but with two or less people it was hard to pull off. 

Despite giving my all for that crappy job for the longest 3 months of my life I was held in contempt for actually clocking at 4pm on the dot and going straight home, mind you I never came late in my whole time working there. Come 8am sharp I was already in my uniform serving costumers, they still expected me to stick around after my shift until the evening rush ended which I was adamant on not doing no matter what they did to guilt trip me. 

Eventually I did quit for an easier, better paying job and thought I left on good terms with my manager. Turns out I didn't. When I left they still hadn't come up with a replacement for the original 5 who quit within days of each other and they didn't find a replacement for me despite me giving them 2 weeks notice so when I left they acted as if I had betrayed their trust and stared bad mouthing me. ""he's a good kid but he has no work ethic"" ""he's not a team player, we couldn't count on him on anything"" ""he left as soon as he found a better paying job"" (who wouldn't wtf). These were all snide remarks that they said around my buddy who still works there. So when he told me I was fuming.
I spent couple of days bombarding their social media saying they had cockroaches (they do) and that they sell day old pastry as new (they also do). 

This isn't a very grand ""I quit on the spot and stuck it to my asshole boss"" story but I sleep happy knowing there hasn't been a worker who got there after I left who stuck around for more than two weeks. Fuck them and fuck their pretencious ass pastry, it doesn't even taste good half of the time but people act like they like it.

My boss sent out a mass email to the team stating that there was a program that they just got access to that tracks what every single employee does on their computer, from going to an ‘Away’ status on Teams (we all work remote), to being on non-company websites, to how many emails you send, and how many calls you make in a day. Now.. I work for a mortgage company and the refinances are starting to slow down so I barely have enough work to make my 40 hour work week productive.. and one day, I had no phone calls in or out. My boss asked me why I had no calls.. I was honest, I send out emails mostly because it’s during the day and if people have jobs, they can’t pick up their phones, I usually get a response from emails quickly, and if there are multiple items I need to complete the file, it’s easier to list them in an email. 

I also pointed out to him that I’m a damn good processor (I hate to gloat, but I’ve been told this so I guess it’s ok), I’ve brought in millions of dollars to this company, and I feel like this micromanaging is sending the wrong message to good workers and could potentially push people out. He agreed but he also said he’s just doing his job.. why don’t you say something then?! If you don’t agree, how do you think your team feels?! 

To top it off, the whole time I’ve worked for this company, we always had unlimited OT and I always took advantage of it because my hourly rate is a little dismal, but now that we aren’t getting the amount of loans we usually do, me clocking in 1 or 2 minutes early from lunch is unacceptable!! SMH.. 

I literally feel my soul being sucked out of my body from this place and need to get out. I recently got a surgery that put me down for 5 weeks recovering and I tried to come back 2 days after the surgery and couldn’t even sit up in my chair and my boss chastised me and told me he just got surgery too and he’s back at work.. he didn’t tell me what his surgery was but my doc said people usually need 4-6 weeks off for the major surgery I got and I took that time.

They talk the talk but when it came to actually make life better for 360 million people, they chose to side with their corporate sugar daddies.

We basically vote for the lesser of 2 evils.

These Right To Work States are pathetic (I live in Texas). Right to work actually means right to break any attempt to unionize. We need more unions not less! Corporations need less unions that's why they lobby successfully for legislation to reduce the power of unions. Corporations only move to Right To Work States because there's less chance of unions. They get a big tax break &amp; can treat their employees like disposable assets. Politicians can tell their constituents that unions will keep corporations out &amp; cost jobs. Bullshit. Amazon still set up in New York despite saying they wouldn't unless they got a big tax break.

I used to stress about the reference page on my resume package when I first left the military but now I don't even have one. It's gone so far that, if a company asks for one, I don't even apply. If you can't tell if I'll fit in the company by the interview alone than something is wrong. All of my focus is on my resume and placing it on sites so that recruiters can access it can call me with offers. I play the game so that they come to me, and not visa versa. This is how I landed my current job and at the max allowed pay for the position (the recruiter messed up in my favor). 

Don't ever worry about a reference. If a company requires all of those things like reference page and cover letter, then it's not a place that wants you. They want mindless servants who are willing to put up with their ridiculous requirements, and they are not desperate to fill that position. If you want some control in your work life then you need to find an employer who needs you more then you need them. They need that position filled ASAP. Those are the employers who are willing to negotiate, to bend their rules, and to give into demands. Why not give yourself that power!?

normally in life when you need other people to be able to do or accomplish something, because 1 person simply can’t, you have to have good relations with them and collectively agree to do it. and negotiate throughout to make it happen.

apart from work. 

because running a business relies on other people doing what you want under a threat of destitution. it relies on the set up that there is always someone with less choice, more debt, more desperation, less ability to save or to move. 
basically there’s always someone who has little choice and will end up doing what you want so you profit and run the show. 

and they will do as you say and often take berating or abuse, just to not die. to feed their kids or sick grandma.
only in certain professions or professional levels people can negotiate conditions and whether they take the job at all. but most people? most people have little choice.

and that’s somehow an ok thing we accept? as grown adults? that some other adults can tell us what to do, when to eat or go to the bathroom, when to sleep, when to rest, when to see sick relatives, what to wear, how to look. 
and will sue you if you publicly “slander” them.

the only reason people who are “entrepreneurs” or manage businesses do not agree with others to start a cooperative of equals, is their ego. they want the power to call the shots and have other people be economically coerced to do stuff for them. 

in a cooperative everyone invests, everyone carries risk, everyone’s responsible, everyone has a say, everyone has to learn to ensure quality of the results. none of this “i invest and risk my capital so i get a bigger pay”. 

and you can still specialise and have leadership but it’s not authoritarian, it’s based on merit and task not overall rule. there’s mutual accountability. it’s human. 

cooperatives are hard, working in teams with other people is hard, but nothing is as hard as being in this degrading set up of infantilisation and wage slavery under often incompetent people driven by egos and greed.",[bit of a rant/political manifesto] people who refuse to build cooperatives but choose capitalist businesses are just authoritarians who want to rule others’ lives and feed their ego at other’s expense. and they feel entitled to that expense,10

One of them ends up being an hour late because he slept in. We’ll call this driver Tyler. Tyler attempts to call the store but gets put on hold and accidentally gets hung up on, so he just comes in. I’m not sure exactly how, but somehow Jessie finds out about this from the comfort of her couch. She calls the store to tell the cashiers that she doesn’t need a driver that just decides to come in whenever he wants and to send Tyler home (note that this isn’t his first offense so yes I do understand her frustration). So Tyler is sent home. On a Saturday night. With only me and one other driver. When told we’re short, Jessie says “(OP) and (other driver) can handle it.”

Just like that I am volunteered to work a double without so much as being asked. Working open to close at my job is only 10 hours due to us closing earlier because of COVID, but I had already worked several of these 10 hour shifts this week due to us being short on drivers and really did not have it in me, but I did it anyway. I’m just livid that Jessie would (presumably) fire a driver on a busy Saturday night, volunteer me to work a double, leave us short, and not even show up to help or deal with it.",I’ve had it with the owner of my store (just a dumb rant),8

Then they are going to be ordered to go to the states largest employer (CCHS) to work as nurses due to a “nurse shortage”. 

The Health system makes so much money every year it’s sickening and now the state is going to subsidize the business by providing free employees under the guise of Covid. This business has been acquiring hospitals and expanding rapidly all over the region for years! The business is refusing to pay the market price for the goods that they seek and the state is bailing them out while putting the lives of Guardsmen and their families at risk. These young men and women have no choice in the situation. Got a pregnant wife at home? Too bad! Go get Covid!

It seems obvious to me that this is an attempt to drive down the compensation for any level of nursing. Free is really cheap… like makes minimum wage look expensive. The military is right now being deployed against the American worker and everyone is saying “what heroes!” “God bless the troops!” And while I usually completely agree with that sentiment it couldn’t be further from true in this instance.

I get it that in an emergency we need to be able to provide healthcare. I have absolutely no objection to the DE National Guard setting up a hospital of their own for CCHS to be able to divert patients to, but that is not what is happening. State residents are subsidizing the state’s largest employer and the business is making more money with less overhead.

Moreover, while one could make the argument that we must ensure that the healthcare system isn’t overwhelmed or that this particular business is “essential” are bridges essential? What about roads? Or food? How about buildings? What trade or line of business could the National Guard not be called up to support? Everyone should be seriously alarmed by this. All unions in the state of Delaware should be striking. I have never in my life seen such an outrageous situation unfold so quietly and it’s happening within walking distance from the President’s residence.

CCHS also just fired about 600 staff for not getting vaccinated a few months ago. I don’t care where you stand on vaccinations. If a business fires employees they lose the right to cry about being short staffed. Period.

Please, if you live in the state of Delaware…. Make noise. Call. Picket. Talk to your union about the danger this poses to all workers and encourage a statewide general strike. This business can afford to staff itself. they are choosing not to and their cohorts in state office are enabling them to rob from the tax payers, the patients and the insurance companies (who don’t care because they make more money too).

Stuff that included “disappear for six months come back with an education and get a good job and maybe then you might stop complaining about poverty” and she said “thats the harsh truth of reality”. I walked away after that because she loves education so much and it pisses me off so much. I have a weird opinion about capitalism. I think that the opportunity to be rich is ok but I also think theres a point where its just greed (probably around $50,000,000). I then think about how would companies would pay workers if they had over maybe 10,000 workers. I don’t know what the solution there is. I guess instead of that classic hierarchy triangle diagram you probably know, we remove the top part and leave the rest. Everyone would have a decent life but there would still be an opportunity for more if you really wanted it. I don’t have a job yet because I’m only 13 and honestly I’m not planning on getting one for a while because of every complaint on this sub. I just get so fucking pissed every time I think about how fucked the whole system in America is.

Everyone in that episode (main characters, supporting characters) I would view as the working class. The fatass is the billionaires. The Blizzard workers are the middle class. 

The skill ceiling in that game is high making it fair so that the more time you put in the stronger your character is. In reality the more time you put in nothing changes because your stuck. You cant improve and that leaves room for everyone above you to basically bully you as if you mean nothing when in reality you’re the majority. The middle class (blizzard employees) attempt to help but in the end don’t do much until the main characters (working class) say “FUCK IT” and just start grinding no matter the cost just so they can have justice against the fatass (billionaires). I feel like I am just talking about the french revolution and honestly it is pretty similar. I guess the only real way to achieve justice is to just stop, prove to everyone they cant live without you and maybe they will stop taking you for granted.

Bigger than a Dollar store, smaller than a Walmart or Kroger's. They had a deli, which is where I worked. For $8.50 an hour. Handling meat slicers, cheese slicers, and industrial fryers for our fried food. I started in March of 2018, and left in November of 2019. I should've left sooner, but the list of red flags were as follows..

* Sorting, and then frying, raw (non frozen) chicken that was one week out of date. You could smell it from the front when I was threatened that, if I didn't do it, I would be automatically terminated for ""sales damage"" or something similar.
* Slicing, and selling, out of date ""fresh"" foods, such as the meats and cheeses. Older workers would just.. Sniff it, and if it didn't smell ""that bad"" they would sell it.
* The ""Salads"" and other cold foods in the display case that you could purchase by the ounce, or pound..? Scraped the top off each morning and re-filled it. If it didn't have mold on it, it was still good.

But, I didn't leave. I needed money and I was at a point to where I would sell my soul for that money. Had to come in every Thursday morning to see when I was off because there was no set schedule. I basically worked full time, but they would send me home at just the right time to where I would clock out with 39.8 hours each week, and since the company didn't round up to the nearest hour..? I was part time, and I got no benefits. At all.

Let's jump forwards a bit. It's November 22nd (2019) - yes, I remember the exact date - you'll see why. I clocked in at 8am and would get off when the deli closed, which was 8pm. Around 11am I get a call from my mom, and she's crying. My great grandfather, one of the many people that helped raise me due to her being a single mom for three years, had just passed away in a car accident.

I broke down. My manager just told me to go to the back and ""get it out"". And I did that. I sobbed in the walk in cooler for twenty or so minutes, and when I felt like I'd be able to drive without wrecking due to crying, I walked out to go clock out. I was told that if I left I would be ""abandoning"" my shift, despite there being five other people there. I told her the situation. She said she didn't care - he wasn't immediate family and he was ""old"" so I should've seen it coming. I told her he had passed in a car accident. It wasn't her ""problem"", and said that I needed to get back to work because her and the assistant manager (who was her ""bff"") were about to take their two hour long break. We only got 30 minutes for lunch (even when working 12 hours) and a 15 minute break.

I quit. Right then and there. I cursed and screamed - told her she needed to take that goddamn cross necklace off, and laser away the Biblical tattoo's. I'm not religious in the slightest, and yes, I was hitting her with a few low blows by saying that.

And then I quit.

Looking back at it I should've quit much earlier. My coworker quit because the assistant manager told her that she would ""burn in hell"" because she was a lesbian. The manager said her mom was a ""druggie whore"", and that she would ""relapse in no time"", despite being clean for five years at that point. I should've walked out WITH her and left them with no one to close the Deli. I really, really should have. Not only that, but there was a previous worker in the deli that went out of his way to try and ""save my soul"". He then proceeded to grope my ass (on camera), and when I reported him..? ""Well.. We can't fire him - we need workers. We can move him to a different position, though..""

After I quit three other people quit. One of which was their only bakery worker. I have never shopped there again, and I'll admit - when I drive by there I flip them off. It was a shithole place, and I really hope that their current workers walk out, find new jobs, and that the store has to shut down.

Also, here's a note - those that worked in the deli made more than anyone that wasn't a manager, or didn't know the general manager (or was related to them). The GM's friend's son started working as a cashier with no prior experience. He started out at $12.50 hourly. He was 24.",What got me into anti work? I'll tell you (Life experience + rant),4

While it sucked that I couldnt enjoy any of the holidays, at least work was less miserable, because most of my coworkers were gone. 

Today, I came to work pretty depressed. The other employees have come back and they treat the rest of us like trash. 

I sit at my desk and the lady next to me is talking about this hockey accident where someone got their neck slit and bled to death. Now they are talking intensely about his slit carotid artery bleeding everywhere, which is making me sick. (For some reason veins and arteries have always made me really sick to my stomach.) 

So I get up and go to the breakroom where they are cutting cake for some ladies last day. The head boss is handing out pieces, and asks if I want one. I told him ""No thank you, I just needed to step out for a bit because the conversation near my desk was making me queasy.""  He tell me the conversation has to be over now and I have to get back to work. 

Even though I'm still queasy and they are still talking about it, I go back to my desk and work, while everyone else is in the break room eating cake. 

Here I am, trying to work through it, getting more and more upset because I just needed a few minutes to get myself together. The company steals 2.5 hours from me every week because they make us clock out for lunch, but we are still required to work (though it's impossible to prove). The least they could is give me a few minutes. 

I get an email from my direct boss, informing me that she is changing my schedule, for completely BS reasons. Stating that I would ""get to know the day people better.""  

They have asked me to do so before, and I have always refused. I do not want to flip back and forth between days and nights. I do not want to work with the day people, who are always asses. When I was hired it was for a certain shift. I want to stay on that shift. 

Now I get the *pleasure* of not seeing my family at all 3 days a week. I get the *pleasure* of having more migraines because I can't have a consistent sleep schedule. I get the *pleasure* of trying to get my yoga classes refunded, since I can no longer go.

Roommate made about the same working at a warehouse. Rent has gone up by about $50 per year as I would normally expect, as this has happened at every apartment I've ever lived in.  

When the pandemic hit, we both lost our jobs. My parents helped take over payments (luckily my parents have money that a family member left when he died in 2016, I pay my own bills and don't want that money, **please don't judge me I'm not a spoiled brat)**.   

We stuck out the pandemic on unemployment/Uber because we couldn't find a job that pays more than $13-$15/hr. We got by. 

Now that rent is going up in March, we will barely be able to afford rent/utilities/car payments/food. 

Here's the thing, my apartment complex is divided up like this: One side is all rentals (apartments/townhouses for around $1500-$2600 depending on the bed/bath and size of the place RIGHT NOW)

On the other side of the street: Condos and townhouses that you can buy (ie. mortgage payments or buy them outright). Both sides have the same amount and types of units, as in literal copies of my side.  They start at $150,000 for a 1/1 apartment to a $350,000 3/3 townhouse. 

Over a 20 year mortgage that I originally applied for (the EXACT apartment I'm renting now, 2/2 1000sqft) it would work out to around $1050 a month over 20 years ($225,000).

I was a medical lecturer, I quit my job in April 2021 because I developed depression and anxiety. I was given like 9-10 subjects to teach, on top of a HUGE bunch of admin and marketing responsibilities.

I've been on treatment. I started a small online business somewhere last year. It's been 3 months of trial and error. And today I made my first 100 bucks. &gt;\_&lt;

Anyway, just want to share with you some stories of my short career life.

One of the reasons why I quit academia is because a senior female Professor said to me,

""You're still young. You should work on your career. You sleep 6 hours a day, and you can have like 1-2 hours for yourself, and then you do work for the rest of your 16 hours. That's what I did. I'm giving you advice because I see you as my child."" OK mom, bye.

And also there's this another Professor who kept pushing me to do PhD in the university I worked with. She told me not to focus too much on my family, and instead I should give my all to my career.

The big boss of the university also kept telling us (the staff) that we are all replaceable. Well my health and my family are not replaceable. So I said goodbye to academia.

I've always wanted to be a good lecturer, I wanted to give my students a pleasant learning experience, I wanted to make stupid memes out of mitochondria and the Kreb's cycle on my PowerPoint slides, I wanted my students to have fun doing their assignments.

But fuck all that. Some of my students are ungrateful and stupid as fuck, some of them had to text me midnight just to ask me whether they should color the box blue or green, even though I recorded a whole video on the topic. Some students low-key threatened me after the exam, in case I gave them low scores in exams. Some of my colleagues are so full of shit I wonder if their colons start from the mouth to the anus.

It's a surreal feeling to quit your dream job.   
But I've never felt so sober in my life.

It's work that genuinely makes me happy and enriches my life. But, I'm so sick of having boomers on volunteer committees making big decisions for me without a general regard to my wellbeing or knowledge. 

At the moment, I am part time. The job that I am doing is technically a full-time job and all others in my field (and geographical area) are full-time for the work that I'm doing. A part time employee pays over $500 a month in insurance and a full-time pays $100. I recently asked my boss if I could add FIVE MORE HOURS to my schedule with no pay increase to be able to afford insurance because at the moment is about 30% of my income. He said yes and to talk to our finance committee (which is made of volunteers). It took them 3 weeks to deliberate this including a brief conversation with me in which I mentioned that it is 30% of my income. The finance committee seemed upset it would cost the business an extra $5000 a year. Either they pay it or I do. 

Today I got the call that they were not going to offer me insurance because it sets a negative precedent for all part-time employees in the future and told me that I should look into [HealthCare.gov](https://HealthCare.gov).- which I currently have at $400 a month. The committee member told me that my boss suggested that he meet with me in person to discuss this matter but he decided to call. 

He said at the beginning of the fiscal year that I should create a report and present it. This report should entail everything that I am doing that would warrant a full-time status (which is an issue because I am the only one in my area that works this job part time with all the same responsibilities of a full-time worker). This means continuing to do full-time work for part-time pay and no benefits. I mentioned that I have government healthcare, it is still unaffordable, and that I would like to try for a child but I can not do so under this insurance.

So if they are meant for people with no job experience then if you get a second job in the same industry/position you should be disqualified from making minimum wage right? You have experience… It’s not your first job…

And if these jobs are meant for high school kids, then the vast majority of these jobs should only be after school hours until about 10:00 pm. These “high school kids” should be in school and need sleep. Why do we have so many graveyard and morning hour minimum wage jobs? 

My point is if minimum wage jobs are only for first time job hunters and kids, then being over 20 and having a minimum wage job would be rare. We all know its not. This argument that minimum wage is not supposed to be a living wage is complete garbage!

my main concern is that I now know that there is no confidentiality between HR, us, and mgmt. a while back our manager exposed our branch to COVID and lied and claimed that our loan officer exposed her even though she only fell sick after my manager had her sit in her office to chit chat (where my manager doesn’t feel the need to wear her mask). 

a couple of us had emailed HR to see if we could schedule a time to sit down and voice our concerns. due to COVID they requested that we communicate via email, fine and dandy. we send off our emails going over an array of issues we have been facing under her “management ” (quotation because she truly does not know how to do her job) to which we get a response back with our manager CC’ed on every single email, so she is 100% in the loop with our concerns. which caused an absolute dumpster fire within our branch. she had admitted to us that when she got that email, she called our HR lady and they “laughed over the lies” and proceeded to rip us all a new asshole and treat us like shit for weeks. 

fast forward to now, i have been out since testing positive for COVID (fully vaxxed, just scheduled my booster before testing) 
and my manager called me all worked up and told me that her and i are going to have a “long talk” about being a team player and working even if i’m not feeling well. again i had reminded her that i have tested for COVID and will not risk infecting the branch. she then told me that this is going to have a massive impact on their decision making for the position i just applied for prior to the new year. 

i feel that my manager is going to jeopardize my ability to move up with the company (not that i really want to anymore, but money talks) and i know my chances with clearing my name to HR is out the shitter as she will simply say: “i never said that” and will get away with it. and i don’t know what to do next other than trying to find a new job",manager rant,1

We have an (another) active COVID outbreak, along with shit head staff who either don't show up, or call out with an hour's notice, so we are short staffed even more the past couple weeks. I worked my usual 36 hours since Friday, plus an extra 4 hours on Saturday, an extra 12 hour shift Monday, and a 4 hour shift last night. My foot was broken years ago, and while it healed and is in otherwise good shape, much of my work is done standing, and it is now sensitive if I put too much pressure on it and I don't rest enough. It's swollen and painful now after working so much this week, so in order to avoid calling out for any of my shifts this weekend, or any shifts I may pick up next week, I decided to call off for the 4 hour shift I picked up tonight. Right before I made the call, my supervisors were texting me to see if I would work the entire 12 hour shift, by myself, bc the other person scheduled called out sick. The bosses were offering me a cash bonus, on top of my overtime. I still had to call off. If I continue to put pressure on my foot and ignore this pain, I may not be able to work for awhile. My supervisor was very nice and understanding when I called off, but I'm pretty sure a lot of my other co workers, supervisors, and bosses are verbally tearing me to shreds as I type this. All behind my back, of course, bc I think they know if they say anything out of line to me rn, I may not clock in Friday morning or any day after.

I'm 32 and finally found something I really enjoy, computer science. I'm going back to school because that seemed to be the best way to break into the field.

Unfortunately due to circumstances, I'll have to get loans. I'm managing to pay for community college outright but when I transfer to university, I'm going to be paying like 20k or more in debt and honestly the thought of that makes me want to vomit and cry.

The only thought more stressful is dying in the small town I grew up in after decades of working in call centers.

I just hate the way our education system is set up. If you want to break out of the minimum wage hell, it seems like you have to gamble on an expensive degree and hope it works out. Like I said, I know this is anti work sub, but I blame capitalism for both of these problems and we really need to fix them because I can't express how miserable my life is due to worrying about school debt, bills and the fear that I'm never going to succeed.

I don't sleep without drugs, I take drugs for my depression and stress. It's like I can't function as a normal person without prescriptions for everything and I feel like I'm broken because of that. I know at least some of my issues are chemical imbalances, but I'm convinced at least half of it is due to this shitty economic system.

Once those things aren't aligned anymore, I couldn't care less about the company or its problems.

Then there's this infuriating coaching bs of ""we are a high performance, high resilience team"". This just means the entire team is overworked, generally doing the jobs of 3 individuals, and also inches away from a general burnout crisis due oppressive workload/deadlines.

And there are companies that almost obligate us to access/share our lives and stuff on Workplace or other company-related social media. For f**k's sake, I closed my Facebook and instagram accounts because I don't like sharing my life and like my privacy but now, all of a sudden, I need to share ir with cowarkes/company? No f**king way!

And finally, we should be allowed to be exhausted by work. To be full of it and, if we so desire, share it if one does feel like it. I'm tired of those who post on LinkedIn or whatever that ""we were resilient in our pursuit of success"" or something like that.

It felt like a lot to ask for but I genuinely felt even that 20% would still be less than I could get with this market. The 20% was to keep me from applying basically. They gave me a 2% raise, so I started applying right away.

The job search process is wild for software engineering. Everyone wants to do interview after interview, recruiter screens, 2 hour coding assignments, 90 minute technical interviews, it's just too much. The average process can take weeks and 8+ hours of time on dedicated interviews, plus extra effort spent just communicating. To have a successful job search you have to review interview questions which have almost no relation to the day-to-day job.

One of the companies that actually moved faster than others, but still required SIX interviews, each about an hour long. I met with everyone on the small team and even the owner of the company. On the very first interview this recruiter asked me for my salary expectations. I told her them, she said ""great, we're right in line."" Last Friday she called me again and said that they expect to be able to give me an offer, but they will be at the very bottom of my range we discussed. One more interview which I passed, and they give me an offer for 20% below the bottom of the range.

I'm just so frustrated with all of this. I like my current job. I'm good at my current job. I just want to not get fucked financially for 8 hours a day and woken up at all hours of the night to fix some bullshit process that failed. I want fair compensation for my work -- what my skills are worth.

I work in a small chain grocery store as a full time office clerk. 

To summarize the old post:  the boss of my department was pissed and yelled at me because I took action to fix a big problem when they were sticking their heads in the sand. I was going to quit but they pulled me back in with ""everyone is leaving we can't do this alone."" I felt terrible, and responsible, even though I am 100% NOT. I was ensured it would change, and everyone would communicate better. I still handed in a resignation, but pulled back into hell.

Fast forward a few months, **and this is the update.**

Two weeks ago. I was woken up at 8am after getting home from a night shift by my boss who was livid about something that I had done incorrectly. I can admit I made a mistake, ok. But it's wasn't something that all of us hadn't done before and it's also a very very very easy fix. She yelled at me or a minute, even cursing at me. I asked her what she wanted me to do about it since I was at home,  and she said she ""just had to tell me I pissed her off,"" before hanging up. 

*So... wake me up, talk about work while I'm off the clock, about an issue that is easily resolved and 100% could have waited until I got to work.* 

As soon as I got to work that day I asked for a moment with the store manager, which they granted me. I basically spilled the beans and told them everything that had pissed ME off, but politely. 

My department head will text everyone through ALL hours of the day about work WHEN WE AREN'T WORKING, 95% of the texts are things that can wait a few hours until someone comes in for their shift. Sometimes she curses in those messages and make fun of other employees.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Some folks are just fucking stupid, she was a mistake to hire.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-my bosses text smack-talking about a new employee to five people she manages.

I showed the exact messages to the store manager.  Brought up all the unprofessionalism I see. I also mentioned the other issues I'd been having about her management style (she has no idea how to talk to people without making them feel intimidated). Mentioned the fiasco I'd been through a few months back and said that this was proof that nothing had changed. 

The store manager seemed to take it seriously, agreed that what was happening was inappropriate, she was being unprofessional and promised to talk to my boss as soon as she got back from her week long vacation.

A week went by, then she came back from vacation. I waited for my store manager to pull her into a meeting. NOTHING HAPPENED. She left all smiles acting like she had done no wrong. She was even nice to me, like nothing ever happened. No meeting about her behavior. No apologies for unprofessional behavior to anyone. No accountability.   


This morning I turned in a notice for the 21st to the store manager. Its three days more than two weeks but that's because there would be NO ONE at the store if I left 2 weeks on the dot. I'm being more than kind. The store manager just sighed and agreed that nothing had changed, so it's fair that I leave. 

They are lucky I'm giving a notice. It's professional curtesy, not a requirement. No way am I backing down this time. I've got family members holding me accountable this time to not get sucked back in. I made pro and con lists and taped them to the mirrors. I'm just donnnnnnnnne. Scared I don't have a job lined up but I'm so ready to just be done with this one.

I don't even make a living wage. $12/hr despite being full time with benefits. The cap pay for my position is $14/hr and you get there over years you've been working there, not with hard work or recognition. 

Vent over.

I started doing a degree in teaching (early childhood education) last year after working in retail for 7 years thinking that I had finally found something I’m really passionate about. I chose to study through a tertiary institute that requires all students to work at least 12hours per week as well as complete the assignments and the weekly readings/discussions. Don’t get wrong, I absolutely love working with children and providing them the support they need to reach goals and milestones in their learning and development but I’m absolutely exhausted. 

I had no intentions of going beyond the 12 hour requirement but due to pressure from parentals, work and piling bills, I eventually started doing 20 hours, which grew to 25 hours and eventually became 30+ hours. I have no idea how I managed to get my conversations and assignments done with zero motivation.. but I did it. 
It definitely didn’t help knowing that while I was both studying and working in my chosen field, relieving teachers that would come and go don’t actually have to have any kind of education related qualification to work with such vulnerable children.

I’m also not very keen on the idea of having to spend another few years to become a fully registered and having to renew said registration every 3 years with a work-course despite having done the required study… 

I’ve been on a work and study break since the 23rd and the thought of going on the 10th is giving me anxiety. I would happily quit if it didn’t mean disappointing everyone in my circle and having to eventually find new employment.",(Rant) Completely burnt out.,2

I was told “take what you can get” “beggars can’t be choosers”.

First off, I had toxic parents who barely provided for me, so I had to work to buy things like clothes, pay for school lunches, pay for prom, etc. I spent my life having to “take what I can get” or take the first offer. I held a part time office job in high school. This company partnered with an after school work study program for High School students. My first boss was really cool. I then transitioned to work for a payroll supervisor, who was a middle aged woman with no college degree and was basically grandfathered into the job. This was pre 2008. Post 2008, she would have been viewed as useless. This woman would berate me on a minor mistake, and told me if I didn’t want to shine, there is the door, I can leave the company. I remember crying on a bad day. I was basically an office assistant, and she had me do her admin work. Mind you, I was a senior in high school under an under age 18 work permit that couldn’t work past 6pm after class. She had me work on really important things that she should be doing. But she would be absent and I would handle paychecks for international offices. Now that I’m in my mid 30s, I realized I don’t think I’d trust a 17 year old to do this. 

She would get upset over the work permit limitations.  She one time gave me a folder and didn’t give me directions. I worked on this file folder and didn’t fix her mistakes. I didn’t know those were mistakes as I was just given one instruction, which didn’t include “look over mistakes”. She passed this folder off to her boss, then she lectured me for the mistakes and says I need to work on attention to detail. Again, I’m a high school student and they should know that high school students do these part time jobs for extra cash. I didn’t grasp the concept of “attention to detail” in a crappy office job at age 17. 

Why did you hire an under 18 person?!? Why not hire someone who at least has a high school diploma! I was basically making around $7.50 ish or something, and 3 hours of work like 3 to 4 days a week would pretty much add up to around $200 ish after taxes. In hindsight, as a mid 30 year old person, was not worth it. I also lost out on experiencing senior year. 

Also adding I had to clear my schedule for the final college entrance exams and prom day as she expected me to come in on weekends. I seriously had anxiety that I would miss prom over a dumb office job. If she made me miss anything college related, I would have put my foot down and said fuck it. We clearly had different perspectives. For me, this was supposed to be a learning experience to put in my resume and earn extra cash. To her, I was supposed to prioritize this job and make it my career. I one time told her it’s important that I take these college entrance exams, if I miss it, I can’t go to college. Her reply was “well at least you’ll have a job”. I told my grandma who was upset at that statement. Imagine if I did sacrifice college?!?? And not having a college degree, being stuck at this place, and not having any options after 2008, your highest level of education was a diploma, and your competing with people with a wealth of experience and education: Glad I didn’t sacrifice my future for this woman. 

This same job also made my coworker (also high school student) miss her financial aid tutorial session. 

This woman only cared about herself and her own needs. I have brought up several times the topic of college. She did not prepare to replace me and in her delusional mind, expected me to be there forever. She told me “this is what you’re going to do in this month”. I told her (for the last time) that I wasn’t going to be around, as I am going off to college. It finally hit her. Her response was “shit”, and that she needs to find a replacement. 

Again, I have spoke about college quite a few times. She forgot that my graduation ceremony was in May, and college should be up next. In her mind, I prob shouldn’t have gone or wasn’t going to as I was going to work for her forever. I asked her her life story. She said she didn’t go to college, she was just more concerned about getting a boyfriend. It all made sense why she doesn’t get it now. She seriously avoided and disregarded the topic of me going to college = leaving. How about you hire someone not in high school.

i started working at this popular restaurant that had been reviewed by barstool media in the past, so we had some public reputation going in that sense. the restaurant claimed to serve a specific type of food from a north american region so that brought a lot of that areas tourism to our place which believe it or not was a lot. the bar was very popular with regulars from the local area because the bartenders never cut people off, and let people smoke cigars as much as they pleased as long as they tipped accordingly, as the drunker they got, the more willing they were to hand out hundreds of dollar bills, which i occasionally received due to my charming nature and dedicated work ethics which the rich business owner regulars loved to watch for entertainment (lol, don’t judge my bag i always kept my boundaries super firm no more than a thank you hug) and i always thanked them firmly for their tips. one claims he will visit me at my new job to tip me more but we shall see lol.
i was hired to be their hostess, and the only one. the only hostess on the schedule was me, myself and i. i thought i would just have to be a hostess, obviously as that’s what i was hired and payed to be, but boy was i mistaken! through a whole kitchen walking out, overworked unmasked employees catching covid (the previously mentioned cigar smoke drafting into the restaurant at all times made it incredibly difficult to breathe properly without a mask let alone WITH a mask, and i am pro mask pro vaccine just to be clear) i have been forced for the sake of the restaurant to take on the responsibilities of the food runner, kitchen expo, busser, constantly refilling plates, glasses, bar glasses, rolling silverware, packaging and handing off to go orders, all of that on top of hostessing with good customer service in one of the most popular tourist destinations in my state. you may be wondering, why take all this on? if i don’t the restaurant will literally collapse on its own process, the ones who get it, get it.
i am lucky enough to have another job lined up for me and i submitted my two weeks notice at this job i am talking about in this post about two weeks ago so this sunday, January 2nd would be my official last day according to my two weeks notice. 
this brings us to today, january 1st, 2022 (by the time i posting this 01/02/2022 but stfu no one cares)!
allow me to paint the picture for you: there is one server still able to work because she is the only one who does not have covid. she is new. she has been there for maybe two weeks. i am doing everything in my power to help her because as of now, our busser/food runner/expo/ to go person/ everything necessary (i love you [redacted name] no one will ever be able to replace  you i have never met such a hard working person ever) is still out sick with covid. please get better [redacted] you are an amazing person and i wish you nothing but good health and everything you ever wanted in life. i wish everyone in this subreddit to work with a person  such as [redacted]. back to tonight. the one server working has the audacity to be such a cunt to me so many times that i was pushed to my limit. after everything i mentioned i’ve worked through at this restaurant, i was pushed to my limit. for example, she rang in the orders for three different tables under the wrong table numbers. as the food runner it is a perfectly valid question for me to ask the server to verify the table number to ensure that i am bringing the correct foods to the correct tables. she responds, “can you give me a FUCKING minute” girl first of all we’re not busy enough for u to be acting like this.
I ASKED HER THE FIRST TIME IT OCCURRED I WAS SO GENTLE TOO I WISH YALL HEARD ME i was way too nice. there are so many other examples of verbal abuse from just tonight i’ll spare y’all from the rest. to put it metaphorically, the one server created the cliff for my snowball of issues with that place to launch off of and explode. after i once threatening to walk out after she seemed to express that she did not need my labors in our first dinner rush, but i did not have it in my heart to walk out yet because this wasn’t enough justification for me to explain to the owner, i thugged it out enduring her cunty comments and responses to my valid questions regarding helping her until about 8:20, IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR SECOND RUSH (this is important) when the only pizza chef came out to thank me and praise me for my good work and for staying through the first rush because i had expressed to him how close i was to walking out at the earlier moment. then he asks the only server “are you good [redacted]”? she answers “i’m not the one who sucks tonight and it’s stressing me out.”
i’m right next to her thinking, there’s no way she’s talking about me? all i’ve done was try to help her all night? but i know she’s talking about me. she walks away to tend to her tables, in this meantime i’m saying to the pizza chef, “i know she’s talking about me, [chefs name], laughing”
she comes back and the pizza chef says “you’re talking about [the bartender] right?”
she says “no, not her”
LOL so i say, still standing right there, “so you mean me, isn’t that right [servers name]?” she is silent for a second until she says, “i would tell you what i’m really thinking but it would make you cry”.
i’m sorry but first of all, you’re gonna say this to the one person who’s helping you get through this shitshow? the only person helping you get through this mess of what we are forced to deal with and you have the audacity to speak to me like this?i have no proof of this but every server i have worked with in past restaurants have told me after i’ve left their establishment that they miss me and that i was the best hostess worked with and i seriously pride my work ethic in that because all i want is to make the servers life easier. i just don’t understand what i have ever done in these two weeks that you’ve been here (nothing) that could cause this woman to have such thoughts about me. fyi the job i have lined up is an upper class restaurant so i must have SOME professionalism in me in case anyone still isn’t convinced.
said server  is a grown woman with children and at least a twenty (20) year age gap in between me and her and she is speaking to me like this? check yourself bitch. 
tell me, how would you react if you were at a restaurant and something was really wrong and you asked to speaker to the manager and WE DONT HAVE A MANAGER WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY. we have a “manager card” to comp shit off a bill there is no one in charge you can talk to, they are simply not here. i can call the owner if you want? i don’t get paid enough to deal with this bull fucking shit. i’ve learnt to cope with my diagnosed anxiety mentally but the physical trembles thinking about my job and heartbeat in my stomach on days that i’m off tells me that whatever i’m doing is not healthy for me. anyways you say i suck? so i said 
“ok if i suck so much i’ll go” and i walked through the both of them to grab my purse and water cup from the host stand, while the bartender is asking me to grab her a to go  order and i signal to her that i’m out,”
she says, “oh you’re leaving?” assuming as of normal the server told me i was good to go,
i nodded yes without a word, she(the bartender) said “you good?”
i replied, “no!” 
i proceeded to walk back through the pizza chef and server to clock out and walked out without saying a word. 
bottom line is, this one last server did not realize how much power i actually held in my hands in this situation. have fun tomorrow [servers name]! verbal abuse is never okay no matter how much you’re being paid, stand up for yourself, if something feels wrong it is.

quick run off list of small things i couldn’t fit into this storyline’s plot:
•i never knew how much my hourly wage was, asked for proof and was never provided 
•head server (she’s just been there the longest so she’s tasked with all this extra shit that managers are supposed to do) and pizza chef mentioned in story are fucking despite them both being married. pizza chef made his baby momma move to current country with him. and cheats on her. with said head server.
•prev. bullet is half the reason the old kitchen walked out. the two other kitchen men had worked so hard and gotten their papers while their families were still living in their home countries. working everyday to work towards getting their family over… to have this man just… i can’t put it into words but i understand and agree with them. the other half of the walkout was due to pure overworking. 7 days a week 12-18 hours a day as a restaurant chef. 
•the original owner is still in prison for embezzlement and fraud tied to the restaurant",i walked out of my shitty restaurant job (rant/long post),5

This all started around 2 years ago when I took off college after Covid first hit and we were stuck learning online. (I ended up almost failing my only online class the semester before so an entire workload online wasn’t in the books for me).

Being back home from school, I needed a job to save up money for the inevitable return to classes and while I was sending out applications, I was offered a stocking job at a family friend’s company/warehouse. Having had no callbacks yet on my other applications (it had only been a few days anyways), and also having it be literally one of my good buddy’s father’s company, I decided to take the job. 

Worst decision I think I ever made

I called my friend’s father and asked him if the job offer was still on the table and his response was to ask if I could come in to work within that hour. Being raised to value a good work ethic and be a people pleaser, I said I’d be right in. This was in may/june (semester just ended). When I get there, they put me in a metal shipping container, sitting in the sun, working with 3 other coworkers who don’t speak any english, unloading hand sanitizer boxes in the 95 degree heat. This is my job (for now)

The longer I spent at this warehouse, the longer my job requirement list became. After learning the entire warehouse layout, I was put in charge of all non-pallet shipments going out of the warehouse along with organization, stocking, and cleaning. All while working full time, being paid $10/hr with no benefits. I asked for a raise once but my boss laughed at me. 

Added bonus: this warehouse would fail every osha guideline possible. Black mold in the basement, forced to climb shelving to remove products because nobody was towmotor certified, literally baking workers in metal shipping containers in the summer or freezing them in the winter

After enough complaining on the warehouse floor, me and my only other english-speaking coworker were called aside and fired on the spot, while the non-english speaking coworkers were pulled aside separately and fired the exact same way. Convenient that they decided to get rid of us as soon as their covid hand sanitizer rush started to die down. 

Thank you all for reading/listening. Idk if this is as interesting as some of the stuff I’ve seen on here, but this is my example story.",Need a rant,7

This just happened a few hours ago and it’s still pissing me off,I’m about to just msg for the 3rd time and say I quit I’m not coming back in. I txt my bosses number earlier asking if I’m working tomorrow as it’s a public holiday and I never work public holidays, also in the same text I let my boss know I’ve got a medical booked in that Thursday( another long story my work knows I’m actively looking for a new job) that I will need to be at and can work around those hours. As I just stated yes my current boss and work colleges (very small workplace) know im leaving and have been giving me the sob story treatment about how they will miss me and they don’t want me to leave, but in the next breath are saying now I could of been fired for this and that and I get away with a lot. It’s just mentally exhausting and I can’t deal with it sense they know I’m leaving. So to go back to the start today I msg my boss to ask if I’m working the public holiday as the week I had my break I was told to come back Monday but I was unaware it was a public holiday. I take it my boss is pissed or just being childish at this point to not msg back. I can even see he’s read both my messages. Should I just not turn up the public holiday and quit via text tomorrow? Ive got 2 jobs lined up atm but just need to pass medicals. My workplace award saids I need to give 4 weeks notice as I’ve been there 6 years but I did verbally say to my boss I am looking and I’m up to the last stage after he found out by a co worker the week leading to Christmas.

 i get there, as planned at 7:30 am. i came from my mothers house which was a half an hour drive away, and was missing out on family activities due to this hell shift. i get there, the managers tell me that this shift is against maccas policy as it is over ten hours. i am asked to start at 8am instead, with an unknown finish time. the original shift i was covering was taken by someone else, i was down as covering a different employees shift which was different from my agreed times. then, the fucking employee that i am down to cover rocks up. the managers don’t know where to put me and can’t give me an estimate of a finishing time.

by this point i am already entirely past this, i say that if they don't have a place for me i am happy to go and stay at my fathers house for the day, on the condition they don't ask me to come in later on.

tbh i think that was a big mistake. since i offered its not illegal for them to send me home with no shift.

so then i stay at my fathers house, and have some correspondence with my managers about what happened. 

essentially my  roster manager didn't tell me that my whole shift was getting swapped with another persons shift, who was covering someone else's job that was sick, but then i was put down as covering somebody who was working their role instead of someone else. so, now im pissed. im just really upset over the whole thing because i lost a $350 shift because my roster manager didn't communicate the changes he made with anyone.

im supposed to have a shift tomorrow that i really an don't want to work, im worried that im going to blow up and yell at a manager

tldr: shift managers fuck up means there's no place for me to work, which means i lose my $350 shift

**A few years later -** The company (in its wisdom) noticed that it was processing 1 million vouchers a year and it was costing $5M to employ the people involved in processing the vouchers, so going forward each voucher would cause the Department submitting the voucher to be billed back $5. Instead of submitting a single voucher for each business trip, our Department directed us to submit a single voucher per month for whatever travel occurred that month. At the end of every month, I filled out a multiple page voucher form with sections for Airfare, Lodging, Meals, Parking, and Mileage. Stapled the more receipts to the multi-page form, walked over to the cashier window and handed it in.

**Next year -** The company (in its wisdom) noticed that it was processing 500K vouchers a year and it was costing $6M to employ the people involved in processing the (more complicated) vouchers, so going forward each voucher would cause the Department submitting the voucher to be billed back $12. There were more errors and processing time increased. At the end of every month, I devoted a day so I could fill out a multiple page voucher form with sections for accounting codes related to Capital and Expense associated with Airfare, Lodging, Meals, Parking, and Mileage. Receipts were photocopied onto 8-1/2 x 11 paper and paper clipped to the form, which was mailed in for processing.

**Fast forward -** Departments were billed back over $20 per voucher submitted. Our Department hired someone to handle the voucher submission process. She gave each of us an envelope to use to save our receipts. Printed on the outside of the envelope was a table with sections for Airfare, Lodging, Meals, Parking, and Mileage. She handled the scanning of the receipts and the electronic filling out of the voucher form online.

**February, 2014 -** I took an early retirement. I wheeled one of those huge grey plastic bins to my office and started dumping shelves and emptying drawers into it.

Jeff Bezos works all the time and he works so efficiently.""

The term ""works efficiently"" is an exact quote and it got me thinking;

Imagine waking up and you don't need to make time to cook your breakfast and pack your lunch. You don't need to iron the day's clothes, do the laundry sniff test, nor do any of these things for your children before getting them on the bus. 

Once you've eaten the meal that was professionally cooked for you, showered and dressed yourself in the clothes that have been cleaned and pressed for you, you get in the back of a new, clean, trouble free car that's full of gas you didn't pay for and someone drives you to work. 

You don't get told you're expected to work through lunch  - if you do eat lunch you don't have to wash or clean anything. 

Objectively speaking, who *wouldn't* be a more ""efficient"" person in all aspects of their life if all the every day basics were covered for you? This is a ridiculous metric by which to measure the efficiency of one vs another.

Out of all the stuff we've done, insurance likes to deny things here and there, doctor recommended or not. Wife needed a CT scan, denied. Wife and I needed a sleep study. Denied. Wife has a fucked up back verified by her Neurologist and get's prescribed Tylenol 4. Would only cover 1 week of Tylenol 4. We thought they meant a week at a time. Nope. Just 1 week.. In total. Neurologist has been fighting with insurance for months to get them to stop being fucking stupid and let her have the medicine she's being prescribed because she has a very very bad back.

Worst of all right now though is, my Wife recently learned she has a pretty bad hernia and also that her esophagus doesn't close all the way and it causes extremely bad acid reflux. Doctor says surgery is pretty much a necessity. Denied. The doctors office has been fighting for months to get them to approve it, and they just won't.

It’s just depressing me and overwhelming to see the scale of the fight, it feels hopeless. Like nothing anyone or any amount of people working together can do to change things.

I want to work, I enjoy having a job but I don’t want to be exploited. I’ve worked for some cool places with cool people and it’s fun, but I’ve also had really shit jobs. It really gets under my skin and makes me never want to work again and unfortunately that’s not the world we live in, we need money to live, to pay taxes, to afford a better life and I’m running close to my limit for how long I can stay out of the workplace. 

Seeing everything with how people are treated, how companies are exploiting people, how poor the pay and benefits are, and having recently gone to Spain to visit family and seeing how other countries do things and how much better they are and how much better things can be it’s depressing. Like really depressing. 

With everything going on in our political and our social climate, being in the middle of the pandemic, etc. I feel defeated like there is nothing I can do to make things better. No job I can find where I’ll be treated like a human being, like it’s pointless to try. 

Maybe that’s just the way capitalism is designed, a way to keep people broken down so they don’t fight for better conditions. 

There are so many things I want to accomplish, and I am in a better position than most people but I still want to be free. It just doesn’t seem like there is anything I can do, I need to start looking for a job, but I don’t know how anymore. 

Everything is broken, it’s backwards, work is toxic, I still have school but I don’t know how to manage that, and I have ADHD which makes everything much more complicated.

I need healthcare, and in the marketplace it’s $300+ a month for basic coverage, I can’t afford $300+ a month without a job, but jobs won’t cover healthcare unless you’re full-time and have worked for them for a while, and I can’t go to school full-time if I’m working full-time, and I can’t go to school unless I’m being treated for ADHD. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve spent the pandemic staying home, working when I have to and making good money saving up everything I can, but there was no balance, no time for anything else. I just had my first vacation in a decade, and it was refreshing. I quit my job but now I want more, and I feel trapped like there is nothing I can do to live the life I deserve, everyone deserves.

I know there are better options out there, but I feel too defeated to even try looking. Maybe you the wise people of r/antiwork know better than I do or can empathize.","Is anyone else depressed and tired of being treated like slaves, this sub has been awesome but I just need to rant about work and life.",15

First I started browsing this subreddit ironically because I half agreed with the message. Over the past year I have regained some interest in politics (which I put aside to focus on my degree). I am a couple of terms into a grad program but honestly I am dreading what comes next. I can see tasks (work) consuming more and more of my energy and time. I am tired and the more things I do, more things pop up. I see my colleagues and some people would literally stay until midnight in the lab which makes me feel inadequate. I would be willing to put with this if that was temporary but I see postdocs and professors and everyone in general just ""grinding"" seemingly forever: I can almost literally touch the hamster wheel. This and more is apparently what awaits me after graduating and I am dreading it. Quitting would just mean throwing away this opportunity to get ahead in exchange for being just as exploited so nothing really gained (this is not just about school but what happens after). There really seems to be no way out, I want to scream for help but it really feels like no one could help or care. I feel like I already have wasted my better years, I am burned out, and honestly I just want to exist without worrying about money or future prospects.",The gravity of things is getting in my nerves and I don't know what to do.

I’m 42, providing for a family of 4 while my husband currently can’t work. I got this job because my best friend has worked there for 15 years. I had come in a few times to help with billing (worked for free) So when I needed a job the boss gave me one because she also needed help. I work hourly, typically 9-4pm. It’s a “small” business with 4 employees. The CEO is a boomer and her husband who is a boomer is also an employee. This year she’ll gross 4 million. My best friend gets a salary. My other co-worker and I are hourly, without ANY benefits. No holiday, no sick pay, etc. 

Yesterday the CEO decides to close the office at 3 we all need to leave. Her and her husband had been coughing all day. I come in this morning and the place was fogged with Lysol. To the extent that my chair was damp, papers curled, and my coworker’s keyboard still has a pile of liquid on it. I double layer masks quickly because of the horrible chemical smell that literally makes me sick. The CEO are on the other side of the office coughing. I survived 50 minutes before leaving with a migraine, feeling like I’m going to puke. My friend came in (from a week off) and said to the husband, “what’s going on with the Lysol? Is something going on?” He’s standing in the doorway and replies, “There’s a resurgence of Covid again, we sanitized.” This is the point where I leave and send a text to the CEO, “Sorry I had to leave work due to the Lysol fogging. It’s given me a migraine and I feel like I’m going to throw up.” 

Shortly after my friend sends my other coworker (who is pregnant and wasn’t in the office yet) a text: “They both tested negative with home tests last night but are getting more tests to make sure. We are usually not open this week at all so just stay home until billing. I know y’all need hours but typically this week is closed. I’d rather everyone be home since there’s been family visits etc. Gives us a bit of quarantine time. Sorry about the money issue but health is more important at this moment.” Then 2 hours later another one.  
“I’m leaving the office already. Nothing to do. I ran billing. No one is coming in tomorrow so enjoy another day of quiet! We’ll gather Friday for billing and then get the hell out as fast as we can. 👍🙌”

I didn’t reply to either because I’m livid. No sick pay for your 2 hourly workers, so they miss 2 days without pay because of the CEO is sick and won’t stay home! So now not only do I not get paid for my own sick time and I missed 10 days when I had Covid this summer, I do NOT get paid when they are sick! But wait, come in on Friday to do our billing and make us our money. Oh and we are not going to stay home, or wear a mask, because we only care about ourselves. I’m at a loss. If I say anything I’ll get fired because that is the kind of person my CEO is. If I go in, I risk bringing it back to my kids who if get Covid again will miss 10 another days of school. They are lying about taking a home test in my opinion also because there’s none to be found. Besides volunteer work, this is the only job I’ve had in 15 years because I was privileged to be a stay at home Mom. The privilege is no longer and I’m at a loss here. I already finished my resume last week and applied for 1 job because I need benefits. We are in Texas and also we don’t get our paystubs! I have to ask for them, and it’s a burden to her and she literally asked why do I need them?

The girl got a raise and now is coming into my department to ""help out"". I am discouraged and angry. And of course im blamed for my ""lack of ethics"".

My mom is 42, she works at a fast food restaurant (I won't say where but I believe it's a place only in Canada). She's a supervisor being paid under $14/hour

Right now for the past 2 days it's been snowing like crazy, I'm talking nearly 2 feet. My mom had called out at 10:30 am for her 2pm shift saying she's sick and can't make it, her manager said that she still has to come in but cut her shift down to 5pm. The policy at her work is you have to isolate for 3 days and take a test if you're experiencing symptoms -which she is. If it was someone else they would have told them to stay home but for some dumb fucking reason they make my mom come in even if she's sick

Side note: one time she said she was sick and was forced to come in, she got there and was immediately sent home then the people who worked there was rude and mean to her for 2 days

SO after ALL this, her being sick and the mild snow storm, my car got stuck and I had to push it back home (luckily I was just 6 houses down) and SHE IS STILL GOING TO WORK! My fiance and I got into an argument with her telling her she can't, and should not go to work but my mom is so fucking stubborn and adamant she has to go to work and will not accept the fact that the worst thing that could happen is the restaurant closes right now. My mom believes that she will get fired, even though we told her that they legally can't and if they did she could sue the owner. Then my mom said she cannot not give a fuck because her heart won't allow it.

The two she requested got denied fast. She asked her manager and he said they were only scheduling her once a week until she brings in a drs note saying she's good to work. She reminded them that the original note said she would be good after five days. They still wouldn't budge.

So she scheduled a drs appointment for tomorrow to get a note to be cleared for work. Her manager texted her today ""Am I able to put you on the schedule or do you need another week off?"". I feel like he was implying this was her decision.

However, my plan was to do that after my four day new year’s vacation. Obviously this never happened as today I reached my breaking point.

I was very upset about this since I hate working in other departments and lumber is the worse to close. Also, I made sure to have my frustrations extremely visible to everyone. So, I literally went to lumber to basically just walk around doing nothing. The new lumber guy who I was supposed to work for the first hour wasn’t even helpful.

Usually in a single day we get around 100 people working at the same time. Most of my managers like me. Hell they even say sometimes that I'm doing a great job. But there's this one guy who's the head manager of my division, who is an absolute asshole and a creep.
 First off he is very biased. A month ago when my performance was better that before, I asked to move up. And he gave the the most bullshit reason why I shouldn't. 

His reasons, 1. I haven't been here long enough. I've been working at this place for over 5 months. You need to be here for 3 months to transfer into a new division. And the job I asked for doesn't require that. Infact, he gave a girl that got hired the same time as me that same job here second week, and she's not even the best worker.

2. I can't go into this job because getting out of running trays of food is not a valid reason. At my place you can only work 2 separate jobs. Once you get a new one, you lose one. I already work 2. I clean, and I run trays. Now that might sound like a valid reason, but he said he would get someone else out of running food, of she became the job I wanted. 

On top of that, he's just an asshole. Hell sometimes make fun of my eating habits, like when it was 110° outside and I said I wasn't feeling good, he ask did I eat all the food. When I called in sick because I had bronchitis, and I coughed, he mocked me. Because he thought I was bullshitting. He's also a creep. There's this girl that works with me, and he's just really creepy around her. He will like give her special treatment, and bump into her, say he sorry and like touches her shoulder. Mind you this girl is 17. And she feels uncomfortable about it. 

I really want to quit this job, but the environment is too good to quit. And Im pretty sure I won't find a service job this good.",A short rant about my asshole boss.,1

Anyways, as i started, there were some things off, other workers complaining, and etc, its also not a modern bakery, and also Eco, so that means that we basically not use much machines, only things are these batches that you mix stuff in and other batch for yeast dough.

I think they also were understaffed untill i joined in, tere was only a lady and a guy, and the guy didnt get his paid break, untill the boss was sure im staying for a while(i wrote a contract for a month).

But oh boy, it was hellish when it was two of us, normally we would work 8 hours daily, sometimes less, rarelly some time over, but this month ? Almost daily we went over as far as nearly 10 hours, and also 6 days a week, the boss also said that we wouldnt need to do cakes and such, just bake, but nope, he turned back on his word, i was so tired, but this was when i was saving up for new pc parts since mine broke down, so i had motivation.

Ever since this month, i am so fucking tired, even now that i have 2 days off weekly, i am so tired that no matter how i sleep, i never get any less tired, and pre christmas eve didnt help

On 2 days we made 216 poppy seed cakes, 8 big ass cheesecakes, and the usual stuff that we did daily.

And the more i worl, the more i notice that the boss is quite shitty, he turns back on what he said, hes a bit greedy and etc,

But the worst things are that we never get the list with what needs to be done on time, sometimes we wait up to 2 hours and then need to work off our butts to be under 8 hours.
The other thing is that he doesnt see whats done, we work at night, and there is one person at day, who mainly does gingerbread stuff, and they do so much less things, so much more slowly, sometimes we have to finish what that person didnt do, we try to not go above 8 hours, sometimes its less, and he recently said that we dont work enough when being asked about the paid break, and here we are, working more but less time

When I am at my parent's house , every single time the conversation of ""people don't want to work"" comes up, and I am so tired of it. I am not from the US, I'm Portuguese but this topic is also starting to get really talked about here

Basically we have minimum income for everyone if you don't have a job. So why would you get a job getting minimum wage (which is about twice the minimum income) with awful conditions if you don't have the need to ?

I love that some people have the oportunity to not work if they don't need and they aren't offered good enough conditions.

My parents keep saying that companies are struggling because of people being lazy

Well, I highly disagree, if you have a business and struggle because you can't get workers it's your own fault. Most people will accept the job if the conditions are good.

In my opinion it's a cycle that is bad for everyone involved. Boss is greedy, pays minimum wage, employees don't stick in the company, you can't get employees, you lose money, so you don't have the money to pay. Everyone loses. No matter how much I reflect on this I don't understand this mindset

Everyone ends up losing because of some people being too greedy. Just offer good conditions and people will gladly work . And by conditions I don't mean just wage, but benefits and overall work environment",Rant about my capitalist family,19

I guessed she made 2 bucks an hour in 1970. Which gives her 4000 per year. Which is the same purchasing power as 28000 in today's market. Which means she made roughly 14 bucks an hour when working only slightly over minimum wage.

I explained that it is cruel to force folks to underpaid jobs on a day the country decided was a federal holiday. (In the US)


The US decided two major Christian holidays are Federal Holidays (Christmas and Easter.) As well as a culture of (most) federal institutions being closed on Sundays. Whether those things are good or bad is a whole ball of wax but as it stands, the country said ""These are our Holidays."" And a *certain class* of worker gets those days off of work. 


But not service workers, most of whom are minimum wage if they're lucky enough to not be tip-wage workers. And they give me just line after line as to why they should be allowed to exploit these workers.


""They have to be there anyway. The least we can do is come in and be nice and leave a nice tip."" Cool savior complex, friends.The least you could do is stay home. 


""Some people *want* to work holidays."" Most are forced either by management or by desperation but yeah the one worker who hates their family is real thankful to be at work and not in their home enjoying their hobbies or pasttimes, I'm sure. 


""Not everyone is Christian."" No, they're not. They still deserve a break on a day the whole country decided was a Federal Holiday. Saying you have to be both a certain class of worker and a Christian to partake in the federal holidays is quite an opinion to carry. 



""What about cops/doctors/firefighters etc.? Should they have the day off??"" First off, ACAB but also emergency workers and Target cashiers are apples to oranges. One is social infrastructure to keep people, ya know, alive. They're also criminally exploited for providing these services. The other group is working because you're too selfish to go one extra day without shopping.



I was a maid for years and worked 7 day weeks, no holidays off. During a whole blizzard I got told ""If you don't come in, someone else will and you can find a new job."" I didn't want to see my family or praise the lord on Christmas. I wanted a goddamn breather without being terrified I'd be short for rent. I wanted to rest, just for one day. And some clients were kind enough to cancel. Some couldn't (needed me for disability reasons) and I didn't begrudge them. But the folks who called me in, maybe tossed me a cheap sack of chocolate and then expected me to grateful for the chance to serve them were the scum of the Earth. 


I work at a school now and am lucky enough to have all the holidays off, sometimes up to a week off with pay at Christmas. Just because I am *lucky* enough to have that doesn't mean I plan to reinforce the exploitation that once crushed me. 


I cannot wrap my head around these arguments. I'm just frustrated and feel ignored and unheard. Idk.

I worked for a company that the owner decided to create a new company under him and shift everyone over. At the drop of a hat and no transition time. Okay, no big deal… since then, there’s been about 100 years (cumulatively) of institutional knowledge lost within that place due to the turn over, some voluntary, some not so much. Within that, this place also was ran largely by freelancers. 

Fast forwarding to now, after a joke of a salaried positions being offered to people and the company not agreeing to the counter offers, we’ve been slowly fading into the night basically. But for me, the best of it all, 6.5 years, our new boss that has had 4 jobs in 4 years, barely 2 months on the job, asked for my badge and company property because I wasn’t “committed enough”, because I have been freelancing at other places. Even though he could have booked me, or reached out to me, he chose to reach out and say, “turn in your stuff and you’re removed from future commitments”. And now as I learn from co-workers, I’m on a suspension basically… (insert wtf meme). 

All in all, when the company couldn’t commit to me, they forced their own hand and made people not commit to them. At least at this point, I know I’m walking into a new job after the first of the year, way better environment and pay, and if they try to ask me back. They are going to have a sad surprise waiting for them… if I even pick up the phone. But I’ll probably send a nice email giving them my “exit interview”. Especially when I was also handling a chunk of their IT stuff, and know the location of the skeletons basically. 

Merry Christmas all! Just remember, you’re a number to these places half the time. And if your managers don’t have your back, start looking elsewhere, cause your number will go up probably, at a new and better place. If not, at least your sanity and health will appreciate it.",Just a rant,5

Yes, I know that this is what naturally happens when a subreddit grows beyond a relatively marginal niche, but come on, we can and should probably do better.

First off, if you scroll through the sub now, the bulk of what you'll see will amount to people venting about their current jobs, their current bosses, etc. Insofar as most jobs suck and most jobs are in fact worth complaining about, that’s fine and perfectly understandable, but really, what’s the point? If you’re at r/AntiWork you already know that work sucks and scrolling through dozens of these posts is just tiresome, if not entirely worthless. Don’t get me wrong, I think America desperately needs to see examples of workers being treated like trash and bad employment practices have to be publicized, but I just think a subreddit for people and by people who already know how much work sucks amounts to preaching to the choir. If there exists such a thing as a critical mass of posts about bosses being dicks, companies weaseling their out of paying overtime, dogshit Christmas bonuses, etc. and once we reach that satiation point we will either see a workers’ revolution or some kind of magical improvement in the nature and quality of work then that’s great and keep posting away, but I'm inclined to think that's not the case (*). 

My second and related point, if you indulge my ranting, is that the apparent rise of posts which amount to complaining about one’s current job or current boss or current company has really diluted the core principle of this sub, namely that all work (or all modern work, depending on whom you ask) necessarily sucks, that pretty much all blue collar work in today’s America is inherently exploitative and that pretty much all white collar work in today’s America is mindnumbingly stupid and worthless. Unless you are unimaginably lucky and what you enjoy doing actually translates to a job that pays money, work in the current economic system will always be drudgery and getting paid more for it or swapping one workplace for another will not change that. The point of this sub is, or was, not to complain about jobs but rather to complain about the nature of work, of work culture, and of the trap of careerism: where the sub used to legitimately be AntiWork, it has quickly become mainly AntiMyJob. 

What I mean is, I enjoy taking long smoke breaks and complaining about all kinds of things with the people I work with but I wouldn't confuse most of that complaining about my boss with any kind of anarchist or anti-capitalist critique of work as such. The difference is that when I complain about my job there is usually the unsaid assumption that things could be better in a practical sense if, for example, they paid me more or if my boss was less incompetent or less of a dick. When I complain about work qua work, I am talking about, for instance, how trapped it makes me feel to realize that I live in a culture that expects me to take time off only when I am too old to actually make use of it. The two are related but the key difference difference between talking about a job and talking about work is that the range of possible solutions to the latter issue is far less tangible and far more complicated. 

Finally, and this is something that might get me branded a shill for the bad guys, but whatever: the boss forcing you to work on Christmas or not giving you a raise is not really the bad guy. The manager of your restaurant, your company HR guy, or your middle management drone of a supervisor is most likely not some kind of fat cat (most likely, she or he makes a salary in the high five figures, which is good money but it’s not some astronomical sum); most likely, she or he spends the bulk of their day doing mindless bullshit that makes them think they’re wasting their life; most likely, she or he despises their job as much as you despise yours but they continue to do it only because they’ve already sunk 20 years of their life into it; most likely they too spend their commute daydreaming about running away to Honduras or killing themselves and they too count all the vacation days they’ve let expire over the years.

Does that mean what they do to you isn’t exploitative and isn’t making your life a nightmare? Hell no. But the men and women *directly* responsible for the bulk of what I see posted in this sub are, like you and me, cogs in the wheels of a soulless machine, they’re not the ones driving it. They too usually have to actively delude themselves into thinking that what they're doing is right and worthwhile. The sadomasochistic American work culture that emerged in the second half of the 20th century (as well as capitalism more broadly) are what created your boss and what allow and cause him or her to continually treat you like a disposable subhuman tool. This community was and is at its best when it explicitly discusses and/or attacks this culture.

Anyway, happy holidays, merry Christmas, happy new year, and ne travaillez jamais. 

(*) I guess I am willing to grant that the ongoing great resignation might have a lot to do with a shift in class consciousness and places like this sub have a lot to do with that, but I am too pessimistic to think that anything happening now will result in meaningful and long-lasting changes positively impacting the nature of work in America. I think the neoliberal state, banks, etc. are always willing to side with employers, and businesses will in the end be able to wait out the wave of voluntary unemployment. Once people run out of money and start having to go back to work and once inflation is reigned in starting wages will begin declining again and we will go back to status quo (I do hope I am wrong).","The state of this subreddit, a rant",9

I think everyone can agree that the last couple of years have seen a decline in their mental health. Personally I've always had mental health issues but before my current job I had them under control.

This job seemed nice at the beginning, it was about just helping people over the phone, no sales, no pushing, just answering questions and solving problems. But of course there were angry people. It's employer benefits insurance (Canada). Getting screamed at, being told you're causing someone's pain or death, getting escalations just from saying ""no""... But even then it was manageable.

A typical 8 hour shift had 30 minutes of lunch, two 15 minute breaks, 30 minutes callback time to followup with people, and maybe some training times or meetings. There was even sometimes where there were no calls waiting and you could just breathe. Then everything changed with the pandemic nation attacked. 

We all got sent home to work. Things died down a lot for about 2 weeks. Hours between calls. But after that respite, it went to the extreme other end. No time between calls... Ever. Then they started removing the training times and meetings. Then that wasn't enough they removed callback time. By the end of their changes we were working 7 hours on the phones, back to back calls with NO downtime. Our expectations were to finish one call and move to the next right away. A call should take about 460 seconds on average or else you're not getting a bonus at the end of the year. Or you won't get as much of your 2% raise as usual.

Then people started leaving. Whether on disability or via resignation. They restructured the teams and removed the dedicated callback team. Now they even removed the email team. People are leaving every week. They keep trying to offload more calls to their ""offshore"" centres but the Phillipines were just hit by a major typhoon which has brought their capacity to just 30% and they're desperate. For some reason they're only just NOW hiring for training class starting in mid January.

This job is a nightmare. For the last year I've asked to be put into a supporting role such as emails or callbacks because of my mental health struggles. They refused to accommodate. I took a leave of absence to try medication and therapy, which I didn't improve on in 4 months of it, and they didn't want to continue my claim (in-house insurance). Now I'm back and they have removed all the ""offline"" roles. The callback and email teams don't even exist anymore!!

Meanwhile in other departments such as claims processing they're firing hundreds... Trying to export ""offshore"" no doubt and cut costs. Their stock is up but their outlook is not good.

When I came back I was moved to a new manager. And this person has been quite cold to me. I explained how being on the phones was causing me physical illness and anxiety attacks and he simply said, ""I understand, but these are the requirements of the role you were hired for."" Yet... I am still not fired. It's funny because this isn't the same job anymore. It's a nightmare. Things have changed and so have I.

I've had some wiggle room since they hadn't bought enough licenses for our work software so couldn't take calls for two weeks basically. Then I was locked out of all the other software for a bit. Once it came time to take calls again I told my manager I tried but it was like trying to touch a hot stovetop. Most people just can't cause themselves physical pain. He just said, ""I understand but we cannot delay any longer"" and told me to let him know if I am going to take the day off.

Considering my previous manager was amazing, empathetic, and an advocate I'm guessing this manager is the ""push people out"" manager. His team has already had a resignation so I figure his job is to get rid of people because he is not giving a shit about anything I tell him. I know that I'm a fuck up in this situation, but this isn't the job I signed up for. There are mountains of stress. Huge pressure. No downtime. Just back-to-back calls with only 30% of the required coworkers.

And our raises are always 2% or less. They do have bonuses but only if you stay until March and it's completely at the discretion of the higher ups. It's not guaranteed income. This March they cut it due to Covid even though our stock recovered quickly and there were less claims made than usual (again we are insurance in Canada). The people being hired now are paid more than the people who have been there for years...

There's just so much wrong at the moment. If I am such a burden to this company then maybe they should fire me. But clearly they're hurting for workers. I don't understand how I can go from one of their top performer employees to literally on my way out when I've advocated for myself from day one. When I was doing really good work for a year straight I told management what I wanted from the job, I even applied internally, but to no avail. Theyd rather burn money than actually do any management work. Isn't part of THEIR job to make sure I'm in the ideal fit for me within THEIR company?

Maybe I am entitled. But I can't keep keep doing this for this long. What do I need in order to keep doing this job? More breaks between calls, bring back callback time so we can actually take ownership of our cases, and give everyone at least an 8% raise to match or beat inflation. My region is set to have a 7% inflation rate, even higher if you break it down by industry.

I just feel trapped. The job market outside of my current position is WORSE. There's nothing else I can do but wait to be fired. Quitting has too many risks and I've been applying to other jobs without any success.

Either way this is NOT what I signed up for.

My boss and team and overall company is great, great culture, understanding, treat you like humans, etc. however, they criminally under pay everyone there. This is well known among everyone and my boss even mentioned it in my interview three years ago. 

Anyway, I was promised a raise and promotion in the new year, which is great, and it came today. My boss called me out of the blue, as I was on my way out to lunch so a little off guard, and notified me of the new position and raise. It was lower than I’d been hoping (though about what I expected from the company). So I said thank you that’s great etc, and he somewhat promptly said goodbye and hung up. So after lunch I had some time to process and realized I wanted to reopen the convo and ask for a higher raise. (My job has evolved massively over the past year and I’m doing the work of 1.5/2 people and oversee employees I never was supposed to be responsible for). 

We talked a few hours later and I expressed that I’m so thankful for the raise and excited for the promotion, but I had been thinking about it for some time and thought the raise would be closer to X, and if there was any room in the budget/flexibility. 

He was 100% on board with me deserving what I asked but said in his experience at the company it will stay as-is and maybe reevaluate in 6mos. THEN he says *“if you really want to be paid more, you should get a higher job offer somewhere else and come back to us with it. That almost always gets you paid what you want.”*

I said well I know that’s a thing that people do but why should I have to threaten to leave to get paid fairly? If it’s financially doable, shouldn’t they just treat us like we should be?

He came back with more vague corporate crap but I seriously hate that way of thinking. Sure I could get another job offer but I like working here and you just told me they can pay me whatever I want, they just don’t want to. Sigh.",Rant on upcoming promotion/raise,11

No surprise I quit especially dealing with everything all for $10/h. It was horrible how I was treated and how some other people were treated, just for the “Jokes” and or punishment that was given for stuff out of control. I couldn’t go in to work anymore after everything that happened. I literally hated the thought of going in for another 4-8 hours just to deal with the same stuff. I’ll start talking about stuff that happened.

#1. The one the hurt me the most. I almost quit on this day. It was in May 2021 for time placement. The general manager was going picking up his daughter at school, my school. He drove into the parking lot and saw me and DECIDED it would be FUN to eavesdrop on me and my girlfriend and listen to our conversation. A private conversation. A personal one. At school. We are literally the only ones in this area and he drives near her car just to listen. I didn’t know that was him at the time; wanna know how I found out? He made fun of me the VERY NEXT DAY at work. He was mocking me; repeating shit I said to her; making fun of my girlfriend yelling absolutely everybody what he thought he heard (which he didn’t even hear right but what’s that gonna change) and I got so pissed. I couldn’t even focus on work, and I was shaking so bad. I went to the back and literally cried because of how pissed I was. And I didn’t want to lose a job yet so what I did to get out of there is I got my mom to call and say there was a family emergency. So that’s how I got out that day. Now let me talk about my manager more.

#2. Here’s this: The GM, He’s convicted of Sexual battery and Statutory Rape. And and and He flirts/talks about every new girl working there underage or not. “She has a nice ass it’s so “insert word here”. He’ll stare at girls asses when their bent over and tell them to go pick something else. I know this because it happened to my good friends that worked there with me.

#3. He literally will say so much sexual shit it’s unreal. Towards me or the girls. Or he’ll put his body fully against mine and say “Whatcha gonna do about it? Oh you don’t like it? You’re weird.” Or he’ll ask us what he should eat for break and then he’ll rub his finger down my back and say “I know what I want to eat”

#4. They deliberately changed my schedule so I couldn’t get the bonus. My friend and I were in track to venting that holy extra $1 bonus. And then they changed the schedule to a day they KNEW we couldn’t work. And then told us “sorry bout your luck, best wait until it gets changed in the next 2 weeks” I was fuming. 


Also to be expected you can’t talk back to the all powerful power hungry managers without repercussion. This was a different manager. All I wanted was an explanation of why I had to take out the shirt from under my work shirt, and he said “because I said”. Fuck that answer, so I said “No, give me a reason”. He sent me home and wrote me up. I haven’t been back since. The poor poor manager was upset that I talked back so his mommy (yes literally) had to come talk to me about how I won’t get anywhere in life if I don’t obey every managers command. And there they both were, 40 and 60 years old, working there entire life at McDonald’s. Right. Like I won’t get anywhere.

All of this shit for $10 an hour.

It's like companies have figured out that people's vices are required to keep them productive, thus if you need time off to smoke the stress away, you can do so for productivity sake. It's almost like society glorifies unhealthy living, vices, substance abusing and discourages people who just want to catch their breath and refill their energy without using drugs.

I finally found a trade I could do with my learing disability that could pay enough to raise a family. Got a grant for school and worked full time while going 5 years ago(school 4 days, work the other 3). Did great and landed a job after after 13 months of an 18 month program and graduated early. 

Now with how this company has handled the big C I don't really think it was worth it. They laid off 25 people and I was on the list at #26 next in line. They shut down my machine that only took 40 hours a week to keep up and moved me to production. That area was way behind losing 8 people put of 12 and they required me to work 64 hours a week. Then was told I'm a material handler after they realized they fired them all. Worked my ass of and glad to just have a job. 

My reward for picking up everything they thew at me and doing everything they ask me to do. Learing new jobs with little direction on second shift while working 60 plus hours; was for them take back my raise going form level 0 to 1 CNC machinist. Saying it was uncertain time and they where freezing all raises. When ask about raises you get the generic your all replaceable and should be happy to have a job. Only thing was no one was applying. 

The labor crisis hit them hard when things picked back up and they have bumped the starting pay $4 to get any applicants. Only problem is that put the new hires and temps making more than some who have been here 8 years. They talked about raises and gave out 6 to 20 people under paid after 9 months. 

Now I sit here thinking was all that effort worth the $1.80 an hour really worth all the effort I've put in in the last 6 years. It's sad but I probably would have been better off to get laid off at least then I would have seen my family.

I sit here looking at the new promised day shift start day for a job I won the bid on in July. Filling out my employee self assessment to justify the raise that they may give. While thinking all I've really done in the last two years is work so much overtime I didn't hardly see my kids any. All while my pay hasn't even kept up with inflation.

This is my first job out of school (23F), it’s a small children’s clothing company and I’ve been at it for 8 months. Up until about a month ago, it was going really great. I’m a customer service rep and I also do social media and some e-commerce stuff. It went south when we got a new marketing director last month. The company is completely awestruck by her and all adores her, but she has it out for me and I’ll explain why (she went to Harvard business school, ran the marines, blah blah blah). The Monday/Tuesday before thanksgiving I came down with a stomach bug and had to call in sick - the first omen. Then, we had INSANE volume for the Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales… we come back from thanksgiving weekend and I’m SWAMPED in customer emails and the phone is OFF THE HOOK and I have no time for anything else. The following Friday/Monday I go to Puerto Rico for my birthday…get off the plane Friday and I get 20+ messages and she decides it’s appropriate to text me things. I choose to ignore her (maybe I was wrong for this), and Monday morning it’s my last day and she goes off on me for being irresponsible when she was bugging me for a password that…easily could have waited. Since things are a mess on the CS end, she brings on someone else to help out with the emails and such. At first she disguised this as “I want to help you, it seems like you were just uncomfortable to speak up, I want you to feel safe 😊”. Then, she puts me on blast to the owners in a meeting and she does all the speaking of my shortcomings and how “SOOOO many customers contacted SOOO many times and are SOOOO angry”. Then, the next day we have general meeting and our CEO says “we’re so sorry for the mess customer service has been…thanks to everyone who chipped in…you’ll see what’s gonna happen”. I ask him later that  if I’m okay after and he gives a vague answer of “yeah, I mean it’s not good someone else had to get involved, but apply the fixes and we will go from there”. THEN, I see my job is posted on LinkedIn and management keeps having discrete conversations around me, yet I feel them looking at me though they barely say a word to me at all anymore. Everyone is being passive aggressive, I put a box down, they pick it up and slam it back down 2 feet away from where I put it. Also marketing director isn’t letting me run social media anymore, if I do post she deletes my post and then posts her own thing. She also wants me processing orders at 11 pm (this is a 9 to 5…I’ve been staying until 6/6:30 just about every night) and she’s sending me emails at 2 am.

I’ve been crying nonstop and I’m not sleeping or eating. It’s so physically uncomfortable being there because it feels like a ticking time bomb until they fire my ass. I got less than a year at my first post-graduate job and it’s gonna look so bad. The previous marketing director was there until September, it was all smooth sailing and positive when she was there. Even for the interim, e-commerce and I had to pull through together and even that got great feedback. Now I’m fucked for life.

I should have read the warnings signs from the person I was taking over for, but I had just moved across country, had a film studies degree, and was just stoked to get a job in the business. The job was a glorified admin position. 

When I first started, I had an hour lunch, which my boss would encourage me to work through to really learn how to do the job. Working though my lunch would let me take time 'in 'lieu.' I spent the first 2 weeks working though my hour lunch. 

Once I got the hang of the job I worked steady. Got there first every morning and left at 5:30. I lived an hours transit from the city, so I'd get home routinely at 6:30pm. So. My hours were 7:30am-5:30pm, but would leave for work 6:30am, get there early, and be done maybe around 5:30. Give or take whatever bullshit my boss threw at me whenever I was about to leave. 

So. Within a month of working there I was finally comfortable enough to take my owed lieu time. Which I did. So I'd ask my boss multiple times during the day if it was ok to take my lieu owed and leave 30 min early. Was okayed every time I asked (honestly most days cuz my owed hours were 20 half hours and I didn't last 3 mos at this job.) 

I had already had SO MANY issues with this job. I rememeber within the first week of fucking working I came home to chocolate, wine, and flowers from my husband because I had a break down from being demeaned and aggressively talked down to in front of students and the office staff for doing my job wrong. (Which I never fucking did). 

Ok so. Christmas. The night before our week and a half off, my husband was picking me up to take me to a reserved dinner. I told my boss 2 days before, 1 day before, the day of and multiple times through THE ACTUAL DAY. all good. Then my husband showed up. All of a sudden I wasnt allowed to leave. My boss was on a phone call. He needed me to be there for however long this phone call would be (he was on the phone for over an hour at this point) + whatever he needed me to do. I asked my husband to wait. Within 45 minutes of waiting, we were cutting it real fucking close with our hreservations - even to a point where other higher ups in the office were telling us to go. 

So I went. 

First week back from Christmas vacation were our one-on-one employee reviews. 

The only positive thing my boss had to tell me was that I dressed well. He constantly stated that I took time in lieu that was not owed to me and that I caused him headaches during the weekend. 

A quick flash back - one thing my job offered was our space for rent on weekends. We rented it out to film union classes (like iatse.) In order to get proper paid work (like a production assistant), you needed to have these classes under your belt for tax and union reasons. So part of my job every Friday was to set up these rooms and make sure all was good to go and they WERE. The one ONE complaint my boss got was that I provided fat whiteboard markers instead of skinny ones. 

This was apparently a problem. 

During my review. My boss told me I was going to start taking calls Saturday morning on my PERSONAL PHONE in fucking LIEU. I wouldn't be paid for this. I may also take calls Sunday morning as well depending on who's teaching the fucking weekend classes. 

I told him I'd think about it and quit the next day. I gave 2 weeks notice. I wrote out a 200 page how-to manual for the position - given the amount of fucking bullshit he put me through that I haven't even mentioned here, I didn't want whomever that would take over to go through the same shit. I mentioned the manual to him and he said. He fucking said. 'this is useless. We're never hiring anyone like you again. I'm using students for your position.' 

The fucking asshole is using foreign students who are taken on as assistants to film teachers and forcing them to do admin work holy fuck.

The way things are nowadays there isn't exactly a shortage of work or jobs to do, but the company is grasping out with all of its tendrils attempting to get into anything it can wrap itself around. A part of this is making competitors appear less competent by offering very quick turn-arounds on fabricated parts/projects. Which ultimately leads to random overtime requests dropped on you at the last minute, like.. 4 PM on a Friday type thing (and you know for a fucking fact they knew what was going on at least a day or so in advance..)

In Canada, forced overtime is simply not a thing, only in the rarest of circumstances. Unless you signed some kind of contract to that effect I guess? I, however, signed no such agreement.

Fast forward a couple days and I'm called to the project manager's office with my ""old"" current foreman (super awesome guy). Where he proceeds to ask if I like working here. Talking about trying to remain competitive etc.. He also said he was worried about me quitting (lol).

I replied to the effect of, ""Go and be competitive, but do not expect me to bend over every week to do the work of 2 people, hire more if you want to remain competitive. And you should be worried, I've turned down attractive offers that are looking more attractive the more we talk.""

And that was that. No more threats. Though I somewhat expect to get a ""lay off"" sometime in the future. But they also know I am very hard to replace. And other companies want me.

Know your worth, stand up, but always keep option B and C and D on the back burner. Do not submit yourself to being a door mat, or they will come to expect it.

I got the new job - a great job in my field - and after a while I reached out to past colleagues. One of them was still working for the old boss mentioned above. Given I’d switched to higher paying jobs 3 times since I worked with him, and he hadn’t gotten a raise in 4 years, I felt I was really helping out the old colleague!

When the colleague got hired, my old boss reached out to me with the following:

———-
I thought you were a friend.  I actually thought you might be slightly grateful for everything that I tried to do for you.
I certainly went out of my to give the best references that I could.  It is hard to believe that you would be so ungrateful as to try to poach our remaining talent.  I thought you were
above selling out friends without any type of warning.  I guess I was wrong.  Very disappointed and angry.

I never replied and never spoke to him again. He clearly needed to rant and would probably have returned to a reasonable human if given time. I didn’t feel the need to check if he was ok. I’m sure I’d have accepted an apology if he’d offered one.

My fiance committed suicide in 2013 on my 25th birthday, right before the holidays. So I've hated them ever since.

Having since moved on, I thought I would finally enjoy them. But no. I work in retail and have since 2009, and it's just draining. The week before, of, and after Christmas is emotionally and physically exhausting. I don't want to go see family, I don't want to cook, I don't want to do gatherings. I'm tired, I just want to stay home,  because I have to go to work the day after Christmas. 

I dread this time of year now simply because of how much I have to work, how much stress I have to be put through. How my only ""break"" is the day of Christmas and I don't even get to take a break because we are driving all over the place visiting multiple homes and eating multiple foods and when we get home, it's time for bed because work comes at 5am.

But corporate office is closed from Dec 24 to January 2. All the corporate workers get a week off. Is their job really so much more difficult that they earned the privilege to be off work that entire time? Is that why we at the bottom don't get to enjoy holidays, because we haven't worked hard enough to earn it? I mean, there's only so many positions open at corporate office, so how are ALL of us supposed to be able to earn those benefits?

I don't want to work at corporate. I don't want to be a lawyer, a business owner, a manager, a stock broker, a pathologist, or a marketing executive. I just want to do my peon job and go home. Why is that so frowned upon? Why do I not deserve more off days, or paid vacation, or even enough money to pay my bills? Why is a receptionist* at corporate office considered someone who works harder than a person like me that has 3 part time jobs** just to make ends meet? 

How do ""they"" even determine who is working harder? How is hard work even fucking measured????? The job I have exists because it needs to be done but is apparently considered so incredibly easy that it doesn't warrant any type of benefits.

First time on reddit ever in my life. First part of this story is gonna be the context. If you dont wanna read the boring context you can just jump to the gossip on the second part.

\-First part-

I'm a gov worker, not from US, so I'm gonna explain how this works:

\- I'm a ""permanent"" worker as I cant be fired unless I do something illegal or have really bad performance review ( its easy but one would have to explain by detail the performance, and thats a lot of work that nobody wants to do).

\- To get this ""permanent"" working status you have to beat a public contest (with a lot of people from all over the country) and work fine for at least 3 years on ""probationary phase"", after that you get a performance review to be the one of the few ""permanent"" workers

\- You would think that this job has a BIG salary, aint you? No, I just passed this contest already thinking about passing another ones that pay more.

\- The hierarchical structure is like this: Secretary of State -&gt; Subsecretary -&gt; Supervisor -&gt; Me

\- The other positions are politically appointed, as can be fired without any explanation or motivation, and the worker in that position dont have any ""golden parachute"" or severance. Its byebye next one.

\- I can relatively choose with whom I work with. I can get to work with the Secretary or sub or whatever, but the one in the position would have to ""call me"" to work with him.

\- There are many secretaries of state and many other subs and supervisors under them so its almost as you could change jobs or at least toxic environments

\- I can too be politically appointed to a position like that, as an Assistant or even Supervisor. Anybody in the world can be (LoL)

\- Many people lick a lot of boots to get a politically appointed position, like assistant or supervisor to boost their salaries, as I stated that the payment is ridiculous

\- I dont like to lick boots and I got to this job already thinking of finding another

\- Now the characters of the story: first supervisor we are calling woman 1 (W1), second supervisor that substitutes that one later, we call woman 2 (W2). The Subsecretary we call the dude SS. Now lets go to the gossip story.

\- One of SS characteristic is that he employs ONLY women...

\- Part 2 -

I started working with W1 that wasnt a ""permanent"" worker, as she could lose her job anytime. So, when I arrived after the big public contest, she thought I would take her job cause I have all the degrees and skills for that ( its just budget/public admin/finances/etc, any person with a degree can do that).

So, W1 would always do ALL the work and only gives me menial tasks, like xerox, repetitive things, etc, cause my other coworkers were already busy with their functions and would not give me anything to work with (nobody wants to be unemployed? hehe).

I didnt care cause I was studying for the next public contests to try to get a better job (and payment). So, fast forwarding 10 YEARS on the same job (yes, 10 years, really sad) in the mean time, W1 saw that I wasnt a threat to her and that I made everybody work easier ( I taught the old dudes macros, WOW what an improvement) so everybody was happy and me too (not with the payment) but I could work and study and participate in many public contests.

But everything ends someday isnt it ? The SS guy dream was to put W2 in the supervisor's place. What I mean is that W1 had a ""political backbone"" strong enough to not get fired by SS to put his indication. Her political backbone waned (after these 10 years) and that was the time SS kicked her ass and put W2 in place.

Welp, I had no problem with anybody. All my colleagues thought that I would be the next supervisor or at least the supervisor assistant. W2 didnt know anything about the job, she was literally the bad stereotype of the blond woman. So, what did she do? She got everything that the first supervisor (W1) did and tried to dump on me and my colleagues.

That wasnt a problem, at first, because EVERYBODY BUT ME got a raise or assistant job (to make everybody happy that W2 was coming to ""work"" with them). So, W2 dumped all the problems on my friend that got an assistant upgrade and tried to make me work more asking to ""help her"" because she couldnt ask to do her job cause I was the only one that hadnt got a raise.

What did I do? I went to talk to W2 and tell her that if she wanted ""help"" she could ask her SS to give me an assistant raise like my colleague got. She said that I needed to ""work more"" to get that assistant position...and other things that I didnt like. Just after she said this I went to SS and told him I was changing sectors, immediately.

The next sector was next door (really next door, same wall) and I decided that on my own volition, SS didnt tell me to do that or permitted. I did this cause I knew the supervisor next door and he was my friend ( he didnt want me there cause he was under the same structure of this subsecretary but didnt try to ""kick me"" from there).

I started to work with my ""new friendly supervisor"" but he was getting some messages from the SS guy, like, ""is he (me) really working"" ? I knew the messages cause my friend showed me.

W2 didnt like that I ""dumped"" her and left her with the menial jobs that nobody wanted to do (she neither) so I think she went to SS to make me continue the work I was doing before changing sectors. SS called me in his office and told me that I could change sectors if I continued the work I was doing before. I told him ""no problem, just give me an assistant job (raise) like everybody else got"", he jumped on the chair trying to contain himself and told me that it was ""hard"" cause he had to ""bargain"" that position for me (and he didnt want to). Again, I told him ""ok, no problem, I'm gonna make what you asked for (when you get my money - implied, I didnt say that)"".

I think he thought I was going to work thinking that he was going to give me something. I didnt do any work from the sector before, so W2 probably went to complain about me to SS that I wasnt doing anything. He asked my friend if I was doing the ""job that he (me) was supposed to do"" and he said NO ( I told him that he could do that, he showed me the messages) and I told that my friend could complete the answer with ""did you gave him the assistant position you promised?"".

The next day, SS wrote a letter to HR to send me to another Secretary of State. LOL.

End of the story, SS had to get another person to do my job, for the same salary he would have to give me. And the girl he employed had to learn the ropes of the job, so made a loooot of mistakes ( I saw her mistakes through the public accounting system we used ).

Now I'm working under another secretary of state, with another supervisor, same salary (10 years same salary). What happened with SS and W2 ? They got fired, like I said, they were politically appointed so when their backbone waned, they got kicked.

\- 3rd part , just for fun -

If you guys are curious, job payment was (still is) \~$20k in todays dollars before taxes, after is almost $15k a year, 10 years the same salary.

No, there are no jobs in the private sector that could pay me this with the skills I have in my country. If you wanna know, people with more knowledge than me are driving ubers and receiving less.

I even thought about studying another degree in IT to learn cybersecurity or something like that (that I believe would pay more). I have a BS in Economics and started learning python on my own.

One thing I suppose happened was that W1, when I was a ""threat"" to her, tried to make me look bad to everybody, so she said I didnt work and that I was a mercenary. I dont know because she would say bad things about everybody behind their backs. I think thats why SS would ask if I was working and maybe why he was reluctant on giving me something.

If you guys have any thoughts just comment, like and subscribe, LOL :-D. Its just a rant.",Just a big rant,4

If you starve a man then all he’ll think about is his hunger. If you want me to focus on work, pay me enough that I don’t have to worry about other shit so that I can focus on and dedicate myself to work.

**Actual Rant**      
This morning I was taking a shower and I was thinking about inflation and minimum wage and corporate welfare and the cost of poverty and how fucked wages are and I had something I just really wanted share.

Employers wants employees to be so dedicated and focused and productive, yet they enable the problem that causes our inability to be those things. I’m talking about money. I’m talking about inadequate pay. Pay me so I CAN be those things.

When I’m at work you know what I’m stressing about?

Daycare: Where. When. How much. Is there someplace better. Can I afford it. If my current daycare situation gets ripped out from under me what will I do.

Groceries: What are the meals for the week. What does the next week look like. How much. Inflation. Will everybody be fed well. Can I spend a little extra on something healthier so I can stop buying junk.

Medical: Is everyone ok. How do I afford time to get my kids vaccinated. Is everybody’s face mask intact. Do we need replacements. How injured is someone. Can we avoid the doctor. Is this script too much. What is the bill going to be. How am I going to pay for my kid’s braces. Is our insurance contribution percentage going to go up.

Bills: What bills are due and when. How can I save money. What loophole can I exploit to reduce costs. What essentials can I cut or reduce to cut costs. Can I safely Care pool 30 minutes away in a pandemic with someone unvaccinated idiot who wears their mask under their nose like an infant.

Transportation: Maintenance is due. Inspection is due. Registration is due. Gas is going through the fucking roof.

You know what I can’t fucking focus on. MY FUCKING JOB. And I’m not bad off at all. I have definitely been there at many points in my life and I’d like to do better (wouldn’t we all). But I can’t focus on my fucking job because I’m trying to fucking mentally hold it together about the entire rest of my life and do constant mental gymnastics about where money is.

Because none of us are financially secure enough to be able to go to work and have rested minds at ease and ready to dive into work. We are so busy trying to mitigate past lack of income and make due with current shit income to worry and panic about the detriment this all has to our future selves.

You know why “men were so productive back in the day?” Because they made enough income that they didn’t have to think about their paid off house and paid off school bills and paid utilities and stay at home spouse available at a moments notice for the stuff away from the worksite. They made enough money to know the car was fueled up and squared away and a cheap cab ride was a phone call away even if something did go wrong. Pop a tire? Fuck it! Four new tires are in the trunk.

I assure you the past wasn’t idyllic, but you could at least go to fucking work and care about it and dedicate yourself to it and master it because your mind wasn’t consumed with all of the rest of your life that wasn’t secure because of these fucked wages.

And make no mistake, this applies to EVERYONE. No just families. Not just single people. Everyone. Everyone is facing this same fucked struggle.",Rant: Want better work out of us? Pay us so we can dedicate ourselves.,38

Everyone... and I mean EVERYONE would say he was the most knowledgeable and hardest working supervisor there. You wouldn't always agree with every view he had, but there was no doubt you could trust him with whatever department and he would run it to the best of his ability.

The rumor is that he and the upper management (the ones that just sit in cubicles all day and you wonder why they are even there) were butting heads. This supervisor didn't get a timely email response when he needed something done, and escalated it to an even higher level of management.

It was the nail in the coffin so to speak and they walked him out. They walked out one of the smartest people in that damn building because of a disagreement/poor communication dispute.

I took this job out of desperation through an employment agency at the rate of a couple bucks under the Florida living wage ($14.82). I hadn’t had a job in several months, partially because of the pandemic. It was a temp-to-permanent position, and I was told I would probably be hired after 3 months of work. I have been doing manufacturing work on and off for about 9 years and my resume has various production worker skills on it.

When I started, I really liked the job. I was doing simple, easy work. After 2 months, they moved me to more challenging (and better) work in the same building (not a promotion), and reiterated that I would probably be hired after 3 months. They also told me they would be training me to be a supervisor.

I started training and getting better at my job. 3 months came and went. 4 months came and went. I started letting them know, hey, I’m still interested in being hired.

They said my efficiency wasn’t good enough. This is an assembly line, and they really emphasize the importance of your speed. Well, I had noticed that the efficiency system was incredibly inaccurate. Whenever you work on an order, you have to clock into a job and clock out of it when you’re done, and at the end the computer gives you a percent figure that shows how well you did compared to what they expect. All in all, I noticed 2-3 dozen ways in which the efficiency system was horribly inaccurate. I’ll elaborate briefly.

-Unreasonable/impossible expectations for 95% of tasks (7.5 
minutes of efficiency time given for tasks that take 15 minutes, no matter how good or fast you are, for example)

-Clocking into Rework (fixing other people’s mistakes) doesn’t grant any efficiency time at all, and doesn’t even “pause” your efficiency

-From the moment you clock in, your efficiency is going down.

-As they temperature-check you and give you a fresh mask, your efficiency is going down.

-As you put your lunch in the break room, your efficiency is going down.

-As you get supplies and set up your station, your efficiency is going down.

-As you clean up your station at the end of the shift and put your supplies back, your efficiency is going down.

-Whenever you clock into or out of any job on the computer, your efficiency is going down (takes 30sec-1min every time and on most days, you do this a lot)

-Once a week, they call you into an office to talk about your efficiency for that week. During this time, your efficiency is going down.

All these tasks are mandatory for my job. No one else does them. I can’t get around them. They are part of my job. And as I do them, my efficiency goes down and I can’t do anything about it.

I started letting managers (several of them) know that the efficiency system has many, many inaccuracies and that I am a better worker than I appear on paper, and mentioned some of the things above. Over several weeks, my efficiency did improve, not because I got faster, but because I became more diligent at clocking into rework (which “slows down” my efficiency loss), and more importantly, I randomly got assigned one of the only tasks that gives a fair, close-to-accurate efficiency time.

After this, they said I hadn’t met the hours required to be hired. Later that day, they told me I *did* have the hours and we could do an interview.

So we had an interview, which I think went well. The interviewers agreed that it went well, and said that I would probably be hired in time to get free money on Thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving came and went.

Around this time I wrote a document and gave it to Human Resources person, where I had a few interpersonal complaints. Here are some of those deets.

I get yelled at for clocking in early.

I get yelled at for coming in from break ~1 min late.

If I’m perfectly on time, which is almost always, I get yelled at for things that aren’t my job/my fault/my responsibility.

I get yelled at for making honest mistakes that are easily corrected.

I get yelled at for breaking rules that I didn’t know existed and had never been told about.

So I wanted to complain about my supervisor/manager to HR about these things, and also I wrote about how incredibly inaccurate the efficiency system is and gave specific examples. I had already told several managers verbally about it, and none of them ever agreed that it was inaccurate or did anything about it. I also wrote that if they’re using this system to deny people raises or promotions or employment opportunities, that was “unethical” which was the way I chose to put it, since I didn’t have the balls to call it illegal, which it probably is.

The HR person said that they would read the document and we could talk about it one week after I handed it to them. I had also mentioned that I was afraid I would be retaliated against and they promised me that wouldn’t happen.

One week came and went. HR person said they hadn’t read the document. They said we could talk about it one week later.

That week came and went. They still hadn’t read it. We would talk about it next week.

That week came and went. They still hadn’t read it. We would talk about it next week.

At this point, it was about 2 months since my interview, and I’d heard nothing about if I could become a permanent employee. Not a yes, or a no, or a maybe, and not even rumors of what might happen. And I had been waiting about a month to talk to HR about these personal issues and efficiency system issues. I should note that no one should ever have to wait 2 fucking months to hear the results of an interview or 1 fucking month to talk to HR.

Finally, my manager grabs me from work and says HR wants to talk to me. I’m thinking, finally I get to talk to HR. So I go into a conference room.

Inside the conference room is a fucking ambush. Suddenly I’m having a meeting with Corporate HR on the other side of the country and that person’s face is digitally projected on the back wall. My local HR person doesn’t even talk to me, they just let the Big HR person handle everything.

They tell me that not only am I NOT becoming permanent, but they’re ending my temporary work assignment. They’re firing me. I waited a month to talk to HR and instead of talking about my interpersonal issues and gripes with the efficiency system, I’m getting fired. They say it’s because I have a low efficiency and I’m unwilling to work overtime (which is half true – for temps, overtime is optional so I agree to it about half the time they ask).

I told them this feels like retaliation, which was promised would not happen. They insisted it’s not about that, it’s about my efficiency. I told them they had no idea how efficient I really was because they’re using a broken efficiency system. They did not agree that it was broken at all. They also kept saying that they’ve been using it for years. I told them that doesn’t mean it’s accurate, it just means you’ve been using it for years. They weren’t even going to let me have the HR meeting to discuss interpersonal crap that I waited about a month for. In the end, they did let me discuss that stuff with them, but I know they hadn’t planned on it, because Corporate HR person had to postpone their next meeting just to give me a few minutes to talk.

I waited about a month to talk to HR about some interpersonal issues and they weren’t even going to let me do that when they started the meeting. That’s illegal, by the way. A company is not allowed by law to prevent you from talking to HR.

I also found out a few weeks prior that my co-worker, who performs the same tasks, who has been a loyal full-time employee for over 15 fucking years, makes only 49 cents more than I do per hour – and both of us make less than $14.82, the living wage in Florida. I’ll say that again. Someone who has worked for that company for over 15 years is making less than a living wage.

Everything is starting to make sense. This place is predatory. The long-term permanent employees are the people who keep their heads down and don’t make waves like I did. They probably apologize for having a low efficiency all the time. Also, many of those people are people with poor English-speaking skills and probably have some difficulty finding better work. Some of the employees don’t speak any English at all. The CEO of the company is a multi-millionaire and owns several companies.

If you’re thinking about getting into manufacturing because it’s easy and available, don’t. If you start with an engineering degree, you’d probably faire better. But I’ve worked a dozen manufacturing jobs and every single time I was a temporary worker and not once was I hired as permanent and not once did I ever get close to a promotion. Many of those times, I did not deserve to be hired as a permanent employee.

But for this company, I fucking did. I worked hard and I tried my ass off to learn whatever they threw at me and there were tasks that only 2 people in the building could do, and I was one of them. My attendance was stellar. I had lots of relevant experience and experience as a manager and I was vocal about moving up in the company. I was friendly and great at my job, despite what it looked like on paper, and I didn’t make any waves until several months in. And when I finally did, they fucked me.

I thought about lawyering up, but I almost definitely won’t because they’d almost definitely win, because they can pay for better lawyers than I can. I’m just gonna change my career path and be more careful about making waves in the future, and try to notice the red flags sooner.

If you’re an adult working 40+ hours a week, it doesn’t matter what you do, you deserve a fucking living wage.",Toxic manufacturing company in Florida (long rant),9

(And adults) but this is for the younger folks. I (24male) used to work at subway in highschool. I was in a work program which allowed me to leave at noon. I would usually work 3-10(close) sometimes I would work double shifts(made my blood boil) but that wasn’t the issue. There was one particular manager who was honestly terrible. She constantly would take the most inconvenient smoke breaks and was so slow when it came to closing time. So slow that when close came, she would make me clock out and we would be there doing work until 11:30-12am. I was a minor and it was a school night. I hated school but school combined with so much work literally made me loose my mind. I quit and had to go a psych ward(for a lot of reasons) but till this day, I have a very hard time respecting a “boss”.  I’ve had multiple issues with employers since then. I have had my problems(mental) but I always showed up to work on time and did my jobs professionally. Customers even wrote reviews about me. But I was making 9.55 a hour(that was including raises, I was there for nearly 2 years) but for you high schoolers, know your worth. I wish I had this subreddit and community back then because I didn’t know much about the laws and they used that against me. Looking back I wish I never worked in highschool. It made me miss out on a lot and it was forced upon me by my parents. But I had to play my role in this bullshit. Lol I haven’t had a steady job since then but I don’t care. I’m broke and have a lot of debt but being through the things I have made me realize my worth and hopefully someday someone will see that.

It's incredibly fulfilling, the kids are such a joy to be around &amp; I never have the same day twice. Unfortunately, due to a recent weather disaster, my husband &amp; I had to relocate and leave the school we were working at. Both of which we adored. 

After looking for awhile, I accepted a job at a great university. They are known for their research in the special needs field and it's a great opportunity/position for someone like myself pursuing their teaching certificate. Not to mention it's literally a 10 minute drive from our place ...

I utterly hate it. It's only been 3 months &amp; I dread coming in every single day. 

It wasn't until I started my training that I realized I had been lied to. I wanted to continue working with kids (ages 3-10), which I was told wouldn't be an issue. I find out on my first day that they only have an adult program &amp; their early education program was closed 4 years ago. Fine, I'll deal. It'll look good on my resume to have range in the field.

The key issue is my immediate supervisor. She's this miserable micromanaging woman on a total power trip. She is always cold, never keeps her staff informed, doesn't trust anyone to do anything with the students, constantly steps in mid behaviors (which you're not supposed to do unless a staff is in  immediate danger), doesn't bother training anyone properly, doesn't inquire anything about my previous experience to see what I'm capable of, and doesn't ask to see how I'm adjusting or whether or not I need help. The list goes on and on with her. 

It's the total opposite of my previous work place. The environment she creates literally makes me sick to my stomach thinking about going into work and having to deal with her. I recently learned that previous staff have either quit, or asked for a room transfer, because of the way she runs the room &amp; treats her staff. Yet, administration doesn't seem to put two and two together but more than likely, just doesn't give a shit. 

I desperately want to leave but my husband and I need insurance for a few months. Plus, I logically know how good this place will look on my resume if I stay till the 6 month mark.

Let me give you a list of what I hate about it and why:

1. Customers automatically assume I’m an idiot and uneducated. I have a college degree. I’ll mention to customers about when I was in college and no joke, they’ll respond with, “Well, did you finish?” Yes you jackass, I’m sorry that I don’t immediately have a career in my area of expertise. 

2. Managers care more about credit cards than sales numbers. We literally get five minute coaching sessions if we don’t meet their quota every month.

3. One of my coworkers got covid and was obviously on sick leave for awhile. He definitely exposed the entire store to the virus and literally nothing happened. In fact, the only reason I know is because someone told me. 

4. Having to wake up at 3:30 am on Black Friday is insane and outdated, but there we were, opening for Black Friday at 4 am and almost having zero foot traffic in the store until around 9 or so. You know they’ll make us do it again next year. 

5. Corie Barry is tone deaf. “It’s not about wages.” Imagine if someone told her it’s not about profit.

Basically i was worried about being there long term because there was a chance i would move away (not my choice, parents got separated). I asked if i should let my employer know that i might not be there long term. Everyone urged me not to, it's not his business. 

A few months later and im sort of starting to understand that reaction. His *expectation* of me to work there in the long term is starting to rub me the wrong way.

Why he expects long term commitment from a 20 year old college student to stock groceries for 16 hours a week i dont understand. Maybe im being over dramatic idk. That just really bothered me. They can very easily find a replacement. I chose this job because, at least since i switched to cart pusher, it doesn't require a lot of social interaction. Im a socially anxious person but it's something im working on (in therapy) and eventually i want to have a more fulfilling job than pushing carts in the rain in the middle of winter, and that might be in a couple months.

Last time something like this happened someone tried to write up the people affected(3) but our shift manager refused as it was something entirely out of our control.

Figured this would be a similar scenario. Except that other manager left for a better job months ago. I'm not angry at my current immediate managers. They got multiple call-in a from people telling them the highway was shut down, they were rerouting, but they'd probably be a little late.

I told my boss I understand the system is going to make him generate a write up (plus a 1/2 disciplinary point) that it's not him. I *am* angry and I will be outspoken about this but that I am not angry at him. None of this is directed at him. But I am *not* signing that write up.

Unfortunately, it's an empty gesture. It still goes on my record and in my file. That 1/2 point will still apply. My boss said that corporate has a ""no fault policy"" which basically means they don't care(nothing new, I know) and that they'll let me do them a favor but when it comes to returning that favor...yeah.

I was not late because of a personal choice *I* made. I did not make an ill-advised stop for food or coffee, I left at an appropriate time, there is no app that I can check first thing in the morning that will tell me the percentage chance of accidents on my work route like a weather app can tell me about heavy rains or winds or whatever.

It was an accident so bad they had to SHUT DOWN THE HIGHWAY! Both ways! They had multiple corroborating accounts of the same thing! It's in the local news!

I thanked him for the consideration, but I did my homework just before this call. I have known for quite some time that people in the same position and similar duties as me within our group make 15-20% more than me and bill out on average $10-15/hr less. The only difference is that those other employees at my level sit at his office and 2 other offices across the state.

So I was going to have those screenshots for this discussion only to find out that two other staff engineers with the same title and similar duties got 10% and 14% raises first of November so their pay is now 26-32% more. And for one project, one of those employees is billing out at $30/ hour less than what I bill out on average. Not only that, they consistently bill out to at a lower amount on average that I have for the past 4+ years. The information is there for anyone that understands revenue and profit within the company, in fact it’s pretty much taught in our first internal PM training class. All it takes is a few clicks on our project metrics database and know what the numbers mean, I’ve checked this method against my own salary and have been doing this for 5-6 years knowing nothing good will come of this . 

The numbers don’t lie, I had the screenshots on my desktop in black and white with these employees pay/raises  in big bold letters. Same activity  code (same position) and you can clearly tell without even looking at their direct costs to the company, along with hours worked, that they got a bump in pay by looking at their accounting codes that went up for the first pay period in November. These were not raises associated with a promotion. 

So I asked these questions. How as a company are we profitable if these employees are working on a 1.6-2.4 direct labor multiplier when that is far lower than the goals established by yourself and others? Why is it consistently like that across the board for almost all projects ran out of our group in your office? Why is it ok for some of us to be holding up the buffet with a 3.08-3.15 multiplier while everyone else in the same position within this group is eating prime rib? Not to mention the group in my office is only 7 people and there’s 3x as many people in his office and just as many at another office. How is it ok if 6x as many people to be less profitable than the group of people in the western part of the state.? If I’m so important than why is my pay considerably  below market and peers with same years of experience? Not to mention where I live is 6% higher cost of living than his office 2 hours away, 11% higher than the office at the state capitol, and 8% higher than the office on the coast. He wasn’t prepared. He stumbled and talked in circles and eventually told me I was right. He didn’t know what to say. 

 I also mentioned the group of 5-6 employees that under individual contracts under the same MSA that I work on that each make 48% more than me (2.12 direct labor multiplier), and we perform the same field duties, only they do it FT and they don’t have to deal with any other BS like being the safety coordinator, managing other technicians, or dealing with other contractor’s BS. I spent 6 weeks in the spring and then July through October working 12-14 hour days including up to 3 hours of RT driving each each day to do the same job as these overpaid inspectors. I still perform weekly inspections and was asked to cover a project under this contract 2-2.5 hours away at the start of the year. I thought our client rep was talking out of his ass when he asked me if I got a bump in pay to get in line with the others (he and his management negotiated with my employer to hire  these inspectors on as we got the contract and their former company’s contract wasn’t renewed and they wanted to keep these individuals around). He told me what each of our other inspectors were making because of the pre-contract negotiations. And I fact checked his claims out in the field with him standing next to me and he wasn’t lying. In addition to the metrics our project database, I also found a spreadsheet in the project file that had labor costs and billing rate. I was told by my manager oh they’re contract employees. Ok, quick search by employee shows that they are FT, non-exempt hourly employees, oh and yea they get benefits and PTO.   This is the one of very few projects that I had not seen the contract before I was working on the project. There was a line item for $130/day per diem for project personnel who travel more than 50 miles from home one way.  I had heard the contractors were getting this even though they are 54 miles from their shop and get to sleep in their own bed each night. I had mentioned that to my PM before I found out any of this in the contract and was told ohh I don’t know about any per diem. I was driving 80 miles one way, and still am once a week for one project until close out. Our client rep told me out of frustration after hearing disgruntled inspectors complain that they would pay for it but our program lead said they didn’t want to burden our client with these extra costs.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BE A MEANS TO TRANSPORT THE MONEY!!! To top that off my manager wants me to manage their contracts, likely because there is no PM or admin time built into them so I’ll look less utilized at the end of the day by charging OH. I was able to bitch enough in October and got my per diem for the 11 days when I was out there FT that wasn’t yet billed, but they wouldn’t give me any back pay for the other months since they had been billed. 

So i told him I don’t have any choice but to leave though I haven’t turned in my signed offer letter yet. I don’t have to leave, just pay me and I’ll stay. But the issue here is fairly clear. He called me back 30 min later begging me to stay and said he would have to get justification to get me up to par, which could take several days. Whatever, if he thinks it’s worth it then go for it but I told him the numbers. He knows the numbers and they better line up or I’ll tell him to get righteously fucked. Perhaps it would be easier for me to leave and them to hire me back on at the rate I’m asking. 

I don’t know why those employees at the same staff level as me got those raises. After I saw their numbers I didn’t look up anyone else, I figured it wasn’t worth my time as I was already heated. It’s just odd that they both got huge bumps at the same time 2 months before anyone else. Some of the technicians and welding inspectors  in his office make more and bill out at a lower rate than me but they have 15-20 more years of technical experience, and that doesn’t upset me. I’m just comparing apples to apples, staff engineer to staff engineers. 

I love comfortably, and I am able to buy what I want. Save some money and do whatever. I don’t have to pay for gas to drive to the office as an office based employee. But at the end of the day 99 if not 100% of us work to make a pay check. I want the same size slice of pie. 

Disclaimer: I work in the engineering consulting business. I used to work in our Business Line lead’s office before he had this position and I  transferred to my current office in 2017. One of the guys that’s now making 32% more than me took over my work when I left that office and he has trouble responding to emails, removing left over data on reports and submitting said reports.  I’ve been told before that where is a different market than the one I left. I guess the only difference is there’s more opportunities for employment elsewhere there than there are here so they can get away with it.",I put my resignation on Thursday.

I am in the cannabis industry, and it's a glorified industry wherever it is legal. I've worked in both corporate and local. Neither is perfect. I'm a dispatcher for delivery (for now), and I didn't even get my break on time tonight. I took my lunch 30 minutes before I was meant to clock out and then worked through lunch.

Why did I work through my lunch? No one else was there to do it. Am I going to be paid the extra hour for management's penalty? Apparently not. I'm looking for new jobs tonight but this industry feels too new for anyone to care that people work 6 days in a row, get yelled at for enforcing compliance, and can't say anything about shady things happening for fear of losing everyone's jobs. 


Also, the sexism in cannabis is astounding. My job mainly aims to hire ciswomen as dispatchers and cismen as drivers. As a nonbinary person, I'm constantly being misgendered and I can't stand it. No one tries and my overworked ass yelled at a security guard today for constantly misgendering me and ignoring my calls to stop.

I told my boss early, warned her that he was on life support and I may have to take some time off to be with family and to grieve. She gave the standard, "" Oh I'm so sorry, anything you need"" reply, and I thought it was genuine.

I got the news while at work. They didn't expect him to live through the night and they wanted to FaceTime all the family to say goodbye, and discuss what was going to happen.

I was literally in tears as I told my boss that I couldn't work that night as I needed to FaceTime my dying papa and decide whether or not he stayed on life support. Something that most normal people would understand.

She got upset. Complained that I was leaving on such short notice and tried to persuade me to stay for the night (this was a receptionist job that worked directly with customers, who would absolutely notice my blotchy red face and puffy eyes). 

That was giant waving red flag number 1.

I lived 16 hours away, after he was taken off life support,  I had to rush to buy a plane ticket and get things in order for the funeral.

After I bought my ticket, I let my boss know that I wouldn't be able to make it in for at least the next week. I had no idea when the funeral was and I let her know that.

She literally texted me back saying ""Not to be insensitive but... we kind of really need you and you're leaving us at a bad time. I need to know exactly when you'll be back."" 

Could also be worded as... Not to be insensitive, but your tiny receptionist job is more important than your dead papa. It's more important than your grieving family. I need you so I don't have to work your position, so it doesn't inconvenience me, so forget all that crap about family.

I told her I'd let her know when I was coming back when I knew. Took only 2 weeks off, after having watched them take him off life support. Only 2 weeks to grieve and then back to the grind. Because she guilted me into coming back, guilted me saying they were short staffed and I was hurting my coworkers.

I quit that job soon after. This whole event made me realize that they didn't value me as a human being, but as a place holder that could show up when whistled at.

I got my first job after literally 100 applications in various hospo roles I have experience in, and some industries I have qualifications in. I have a graduate diploma and a goddamn master's degree. Not that anyone cares.

Job #1 - Fast food chain. I've worked a similar one. Easy stuff, I know what I'm doing. I show up on time, clean, get the work done. I deal with the nineteen year old calling me ""honey/dear/sweetie"" despite my many corrections of my name. As she's explaining how to restock a fridge (seriously?), I cut her off to remind her I know what I'm doing. I did it yesterday, even. She rants back about how rude I am, calls me honey one more time. I get an email that evening that I'm fired. Okay, so I'm not a team player - but I put up with your rudeness, coddling, and your huge fake nails, loose hair, and inability to wash your hands or store food properly.

Job #2 - Barista in the morning. (Same day I got a job in the evenings at as a waitress) I was super excited for this. They wanted someone to train from the ground up in barista skills, and I really wanted to learn that mysterious coffee machine. I picked it up quickly, served through a rush, got compliments. What I didn't get was paid. For three weeks. I got one payslip that missed half my shifts and claimed to have paid me $6 an hour less than what the boss agreed to in a text message. So I chase up the missing hours. Get a little bit. Chase up the other missing hours. A bit more. I bleed it out of him until at last I get five payslips all on the same day, a deposit, a pay correction, and a notice that I'm fired. Well, I will take my new barista skills and go.

Job #3 - Tutoring. I'm literally a teacher. I suffer through the introductory week where they teach me strategies I do in my sleep. Then it's revealed that they don't run over the summer holidays and will be closed for two months - that's not the kind of gap my bank account can handle. So I have to change my availability to make the waitress gig happy, and keep me paid. So, I have poor availability now and they let me go. Fair enough.

Job #4 - Waitressing. I waitress the hell out of this restaurant. I love everyone there. We have drinks after work. We're a good team who helps each other. It's great. It's also next to the zoo and has an infestation of cockroaches and rats and was just shut down by the health department. So there goes Job #4.

&amp;#x200B;

Aaaaaaand I'm unemployed, sending out twenty applications a day again. Where is this shortage of skilled workers I keep hearing about? I don't plan on staying here for the entirety of the next school year, so I'm resistant to register as a teacher in this state knowing I'll just leave the kids.

My next move? Get an ABN and go back to exotic dancing (which I actually really enjoy). I've made a few friends in the industry while I've been here and they're keen for me to join them. Get those dolla bills out, y'all....and don't tell the schools in the area. XD",A Rant of 4 Jobs,4

(I apologize for my grammar)

This all started in July when I applied for a part-time minimum wage Burger King position because I am a student and need money. During the interview with the GM of the restaurant he said that he is pretty sure I'm hired he just needs to check some things and he'll get back to me but to email my SIN (I'm canadian) and direct deposit info to the company. I told him I will do that if I am confirmed to be hired. A few days later I got a call saying I'm hired and he'll call me back the next day with my schedule. The next day comes and I email my stuff to them and no call. I called them that evening and asked what was up. The person working told me I wasn't hired yet and the person shouldn't have called. Then the NEXT DAY they call me back and go yea your hired THAT person shouldn't have said that. Then they asked my to send a picture of my SIN to them and I said no I'll do that in person so I know I'm really talking to a Burger King employee. He said ok and told me to come in the next day and we will sort it out. I go the next day and everything's going smoothly then something didn't work and he straight up showed me another employees banking info with their address and everything to me as an example. So I now know how well they respect privacy here. After that it went somewhat smoothly minus the fact that I was working 30 hours part time one week and zero shifts the next and was shamed for taking sick days and encouraged to break provincial guidelines to come it to work while awaiting a covid test. (Obviously I said no) After a month of that then they fucking ghosted me for 3 months with zero contact at all and didn't pick up any calls. Then they had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to come in the very next day for work. At that point I was done and just quit.
(I don't know if this fits this subreddit or not hopefully it does)

TL:DR:Burger King gives and revokes a job offer and works me part time 30 hours one week with no sick days then no shifts the next week then proceeds to ghost me for 3 months and booty calls me asking to come in tmr",My insane 5 month experience working for Burger King (RANT),11

Luckily I guess, he is retiring next year and with his old income level paying into social security, he said he will be making about the same from social security that he’s making now. He also has a small 401k which will help.

My coworkers are amazing, my boss gives a ton of benefits and perks because she believes in taking care of employees first and let them take care of the customers.

Her husband thinks he’s the owner of the company, and likes to make the office team do alot of things that are way out of our job descriptions.

We have regular meetings to discuss future business, safety, maintenance, etc. and anytime she has a great idea for the company, he will start saying it’s stupid and other things, during the meetings!

And, the staff are starting to talk to each other, and we’re all feeling like leaving. My stress levels have been through the roof lately, and I just wanted to vent a little and hopefully get some advice!

Last night I received some personal news that caused me to have a bit of a mental breakdown.. panic attacks, disassociation and generally a bad time. It became apparent to me that I was not going to be able to travel 2.5 hours to this event and be friendly and talkative in this state, so late last night I managed to send an email to my boss explaining that I’m really sorry but I won’t make it due to a personal situation. I apologised profusely and explained that I’d still of course do my normal work day, just not attend the event. 

This morning my boss called me, clearly not happy. He opened the conversation with, ‘so? Tell me what’s happened?’ 

I had resolved not to tell him. I had made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t feel pressured into discussing personal issues with him. I hadn’t really let him down, the event went ahead completely fine, and even if I had let him down - my mental health comes first. So I didn’t respond, just said that I was sorry but something personal had come up. 

He responded, ‘I know, what was it?’

In the silence that followed I just cracked. I told him. Against my own better judgement I discussed my family life and mental health with my boss as an attempt to justify why I didn’t attend a meaningless, optional event. 

And, after I spilled my guts about how panicked, anxious and distressed I was, all he had to say was: ‘hmm. I don’t see why any of that is a reason why you couldn’t come’

Again, against my better judgement I launched into an apology. He cut me off to say: ‘We’ll discuss this later’

Then he hung up. And I’m even more miserable and anxious than before. But more than anything I’m mad at myself for not saying what I believe is the right thing, which is that my personal issues aren’t his business and they take priority over any stupid networking event that I wasn’t even needed at.","A rant, because I’m mad at myself",18

I worked at my old job for 5 years and finally left. I left because of upper management and the lack of support from higher ups. I left because I was doing the job of 3 people and not even being paid properly for one persons job (commission based job). 

 It was hard to let go. It was hard to say goodbye to so many friendly faces. It was hard to get walk away from everything I helped build up, but I’m glad I did it. My old coworkers reassured me that I deserved better (they knew all the bullshit I had to deal with)

It’s a shame because these companies know that you will care for your fellow coworker. Old coworkers of mine were told to try and “retain” me. Some tried, others were honest and told me what management said. All and all I don’t regret my time there. I only regret I stayed as long as I did.

I got a degree in Theater.  My parents helped me pay tuition (very lucky to be me) and I paid my first year out of savings and paid all living expenses and book on my own.  I started and ran a creatively successful theatre company for ten years, while working side jobs the entire time to keep my head above water financially.  Won awards for my theatre work, was never able to ""make a living"" in the USA.  I moved to Germany in 2010 to escape an abuser and change my life.  Worked at a famous theatre in Berlin, have done my own projects successfully.  My family applied for and got dual citizenship in Italy (through heritage).  I've been living in Germany for 11 years.

Due to boredom and wanderlust, I decided to shift gears and apply to teach drama in China.  I got a job easily and am excited for a new adventure, to learn a new language, and explore a new culture.  It has taken me a long time to get my Chinese Visa, due to COVID and politics between the USA and China.  So I've been staying with my grandmother in San Francisco for a month.

My grandfather was a high school chemistry teacher.  He was overworked and underpaid. My cousin is an Italian teacher at the same school.  Her husband is a teacher in a nearby district.  They are overworked and underpaid in one of the most expensive areas of the United States.  Today I was talking to my grandmother, saying how I intend on working only the 40 hours my contract states I am obligated to work.  She says to me ""Well how exactly do you plan on doing that?"".  I thought I was pretty clear ""Well, I'm not going to work hours I am not being paid for.""  She goes ""Well, your grandfather always worked way more than he was contracted to work.  That's just the way it is.""  I say ""Well, it shouldn't have been that way then, and it doesn't have to be that way now.  People should work the hours they are contracted to work.  More than 40 hours a week is too much for a good work-life balance.  I think people should work even less than that.""  She goes ""Well, that's impossible and just lazy.  The kids need you.""  Such a frustrating interaction!  Passing the buck and burden on to teachers is really fucked up...like generational trauma, being passed down from one generation of teachers to the next...

I told my sister about this, and she goes ""Well, Grandma has a point.  China's work ethic is different than Europe's, you will probably have to work over 40 hours per week there.""  To this I said ""No, I won't.  I will work my contracted hours.  The USA and China are not harder workers or have better work ethic because they like to force their employees to work crazy hours.  Holding my employer to our CONTRACT is not wrong and standing up for worker's rights does not make me lazy.""

I am so tired of this shit.  I thought that my family would want me to have a good work-life balance and would want to support me in holding my employer to their word.  I also talk to my family about this stuff because I want them to see life as an employee doesn't have to be so shitty but they insist on defending ""American values"" of ""hard work"" (aka exploitation).

I honestly hope my visa comes through really soon because I can't stay with these people much longer!  I love them, but they are fucking BLIND.

Thank you for hearing me.  I've been holding this in for a long time.

EDIT:  I'm not going to be a teacher forever.  I can work for a few years in China teaching drama (a skill I honed over 30 years) with good benefits and perks, something my lack of a Master in Education prohibits me from doing in Germany.  My goal is to make enough money to buy a house for me and my sister in the mountains in Italy.  And work my theatre stuff when I want to.  ",American Family think I'm a lazy elitist (Rant),20

Each time with a temporary contract of 1 year. However, it's the law in the Netherlands that after 2 temporary contracts you need to get a fixed contract. 

Lo and behold, 2 months before the ending of my contract I got called in by the manager, and she explained that she couldn't renew my contract because their expenses per hour on staff salary were too high. Meaning that they would have to hire teenagers, who are cheaper, to replace the current (older) staff members. Apparently, as a 22 year old who works at the restaurant 3 days a month, I'm ""too expensive"" per hour. 

What didn't add up though, was that since two months prior the restaurant had adopted an ""open hiring"" method. Meaning that you can apply for the job without going through the interview process, and that they will hire absolutely anyone. So the letting me go in order to hire more teenager was a lie. This was later confirmed by other team leaders and colleagues. My manager just didn't want to give me a fixed contract. 

I had already guessed my contract wouldn't get renewed, but just.. tell me the truth? Why lie? 

Four weeks before my last working day on December 12th I suddenly got added to a new groupschat on Whatsapp for 2022. On that groupschat the manager explained why she created this chat already in November: to ask us for money for a goodbye present because two team leaders were leaving. 

She added me to a groupschat for 2022, even though I would be leaving mid December, to ask me for money for the goodbye presents for two team leaders who would leave the restaurant AFTER ME. I didn't even respond.

And if that wasn't bad enough, it gets worse:

Last week new Covid-19 measures were introduced which impacted restaurants. The manager told everyone to check their schedule because she had made some changes. This was on Friday evening. I checked it then, and I didn't see any changes. I still had to work 3 Sundays until my last day on December 12th. 

The following Sunday I had to work. After finishing my day and going to the changing room to go home, I checked the schedule again because my colleague asked me if he would see me again before I'd leave as he'd be going on vacation. That's when I found out my manager REMOVED ME FROM THE REST OF THE SCHEDULE. So all of the sudden this was my last day of work. The manager must've changed the schedule either that Saturday or Sunday, and hadn't even given me a heads-up that this would be my last day. 

So quickly I said goodbye to everyone working there, and later that day I said goodbye in the groupschat. Among other colleagues my manager responded (she wasn't working that Sunday so she missed my sudden last day). Misspelling my name. After that I exited the groupschat, and that was that.

Or so I thought.

A couple of days ago I got called by the manager. Saying she read my message, and that if I wanted I could still work on December 12th, and make that my last working day after all. Apparently they were really desperate and they needed more people to work.

After I said goodbye to everyone, and exited the groupschat. 

I told her a very clear no.

This company doesn't pay her the drive in between houses, the houses are usually scheduled to where there's no real break in between houses, no time to eat food or get gas or anything. 

A couple of months ago my wife had gotten fired because she said she was outside the house when she was actually still on her way. When she got to the house the person called the boss to let her know she was late and it resulted in my wife getting fired after a heated argument. My wife wanted to place her 2 weeks notice in when the boss said ""you know what? This can be your last day sweetie."" When my wife filed for unemployment the company denied the request and got in touch with her to play victim and say the firing was a ""misunderstanding"" and that they wanted her back. 

They offered my wife her job back with a contract. She gets an instant $500 bonus if she comes back but if she quits or gets fired before December 1st, they keep her last check. We were struggling financially at that point so my wife signed the deal with the devil. 

Everything was ""okay"" except the other things in the contract  from my wife's side were getting broken. They promised my wife that they will wash her work towels until they decided they couldn't no more. (We don't have a washer or dryer). They promised my wife she wouldn't be in the schedule early until they decided that they  really needed her to get there early. 

Okay now getting to the main point. It's December 1st. My wife wakes up late. She goes to the house and gets a message about a meeting after work. She finishes her house and goes to the boss. ""We really really don't want to fire you so we're cutting your pay from 48% to 35% for each house"". So the same amount of hard work, the same no break bullshit, the same waking up early/staying up all night to wash towels for 13% less of the pay? 
Is it legal to cut her pay that way anyways? Also she is down to only one house for every work day, but they usually add a last minute house before almost finishing out the day.



EDIT: I forgot about this story. At some point during the summer, we had lost a friend who at some point was a roommate. From what we know, the girl was very depressed and very self destructive and she ended up killing her self. My wife either gets there late or had requested the day off because of it and the boss comes up with ""well your coworker is still working despite her grandparents passing away"". What a weird flex. She should have just said ""There's no time for grieving,  I have money to make"". Also the coworker in question is pretty much the one who makes the schedule and takes calls from home. There's a difference between sitting at home working and going face to face with costumers and cleaning but honestly, both of them should have taken the day off regardless.",A rant about my wife's job.,16

The greatest failure of capitalism is the failure of capitalism to effectively combat issues in even the near future. Because the systems of capitalism more consistently reward faster solutions, they consistently create more opportunities for quick improvements becoming the solution. By producing a product not of the highest quality, but of the highest at the fastest rate, one is able to easily manipulate a market by instantly pushing supply up or down, simply by reducing or increasing their supply. This creates an inherent bias towards producers with greater capital, as by utilizing that capital, a producer is transferred an advantage over all other producers. While not always a massive advantage, or even one that can be exploited if the capital is limited, it is always still an advantage. Look to the United States of America, where, despite having a relatively young global age, the nation has achieved immense global presence militarily and economically. This is due to the immense natural resources available within the American landscape (a fact which has not been lost on “enterprising” Americans) and what makes America unique: its explicit exploitation of labor through a clear line of legislation whose main intent has always been siphoning as much of the originating source of that power: labor, while consolidating that power in the hands of the already powerful. Interestingly enough, the antiquated barons of actual feudalistic, medieval power operated in much the same way, with their serfs depending entirely on each baron they worked for. The only difference to the modern-day serf is to how their paycheck is now split. Every dollar a serf earns is spent on taxes to their baron or to merchants within the barons employ, which provides for them housing, security, food, water, a job, essentially everything one could hope to live to a ripe age of 30, if you were lucky. In return, for taking all that the peasant produces, a baron provides the bare necessity to support human life, not comfort, not happiness, not meaning. And society has certainly progressed from then, as obviously our life expectancies have risen. The modern-day baron will take two things from you. Your time, and your money. They will offer two things. Your everyday basic necessities for human survival and materialistic, hyper-hyped, luxury versions of those necessities. Both cost money and only one group has the ability to consume the latter. Modern day barons sell houses, food, water access, electricity, education, and drugs. Modern day barons, on principle, supply the things every human need for survival. They literally control the lives of every person, and it doesn’t matter whether or not they are malicious with that power, as the system that power is structured within is fundamentally skewed towards individuals already in possession of that power. While the system truly does allow for certain opportunities when “anyone” can become successful, the straight facts consistently show inequities in those success rates based purely on geographical location, race, and income level at birth. Thus, clearly capitalism has failed to successfully improve upon what we would deem an unjust society. Assuming that societal progress will surely be the result of capitalist principles is plainly ignorant, as the most important capitalist principle is to make money. Not helping people, not making sure freedom will always be number one, not keeping our guns safe (except maybe those, guns are expensive you know). Capitalism is about making the most money, and simply put: making money off of it is the worst way to successfully combat any kind of injustice. When capitalism is left unchecked, it runs rampant against the humans it exploits, regardless of political background or ethnicity, though unfortunately it has historically focused intently on groups that have been oppressed, as it is far easier to normalize an agenda of hatred upon a group of people that are misunderstood than to normalize hatred about a group that is well understood. The real inequality in this country, is income inequality. Lower class people don’t exist. That’s a myth telling you that people with less money are somehow lesser than someone with more money, like their ability to produce a made-up currency within a made-up society is somehow relevant to their intrinsic value as a human. The pure idea that society should be based on a currency that comes from labor is a generally good one, as it assures that all actually contribute to the society that they live in, until the system is revealed to be broken, with the obvious advantage being conferred to the biggest most successful producer. And the best part is, its never ending. Every time a business goes out of business, it really just means another business is taking over that businesses’ part of the market share, at very least a fraction of it. As such, the “market meets the demand,” only, the demand will always be there, assuming the market is a necessity for any kind of modern society, and what really has happened is a consolidation of power towards a single, large individual company. Capitalist societies have seen it happen time and time again, from the oil barons of the 19th century to the multi billionaires of the dot com era. Every time major innovation has been spurred, only certain people find their pocketbooks swelling, and it’s consistently the same act of one lowly firm slowly establishing dominance within their market through monopolistic practices. And monopolies breed unethical business practices; one only needs glance at the American pharmaceutical industry and its wildly unethical drug peddling that includes lying to doctors about addictive prescriptions and raising prices on lifesaving medicine by literally thousands of percent what they used to cost. Capitalism is about always making money, and money is about appearing the best. If you have the most money, you must obviously be winning this thing called life, right? That’s the prevailing theory among the poor, probably because the rich keep trying to imply with ads full of smiling actors. Unfortunately for rich people, never has exorbitant luxury meant happiness. Unfortunately for poor people, enormous poverty has always resulted in immense suffering. Consider a society where workers might not have to work such mundane jobs. Consider a society where school isn’t considered such a terrible place for so many people because their curriculum doesn’t follow capitalist propaganda spirals, but instead follows areas of possible interest so that instead of being forced into a career “for the money,” students can pursue something they enjoy, diverting their personal passions into innovations, the way humans have always done, even in the face of restrictive industries focused solely on money. How about we stop valuing people’s arbitrary abilities at converting numbers to bigger ones, and start seeing their actions, words, and expressions as their greatest personality features. Because when the country’s poor consistently find themselves unable to attain even basic necessities while fully working for that society, it is time for that society to change. It is not for the people of a just society to simply note injustice, as that is compliance with that injustice. I ask then, are we just? What do you value more, the concept of working for the biggest number of dollars out of all other people, or human lives as they encounter societally induced oppression? Ultimately, can you morally justify you’re need for yourself or others to attain more money than other people? In a society which could - if there was money available for taking - provide permanent food, water, and shelter to every human, suffering or not, in the country, should there even be a question in your mind about it to providing them? Is our goal as a society not to surpass the inconstance and uneasiness of hunger in pursuit of something beyond the meaningless struggle of surviving from day to day? Ask enough poor people whether they feel closer to the bottom of the evolutionary ladder than rich people and the smacks you’ll receive should be enough to tell you that poor people are no less human than any wealthy person. They are just as likely to be insanely perceptive as they are to be insanely inane. The only reason they have failed economically is because our system requires inequality. Poor people are almost always born in poor families and the continuous exploitation of these populations is what has kept the rich, rich for generations. What is essential to understand is that the people in power don’t matter: they could be white, black, or aliens. As long as they utilize our labor to enhance their own power, workers will not be working for their own success. Every hour we give to those robbing our labor, is an hour we could use to show them how essential we are to their money generating successes. Every product we refuse to purchase means less of their capital flowing back into the system for their massive, greedy hands to absorb. While we must depend on their systems for survival, when we show them that their system’s survival also depends on our backs as laborers, mentally or physically, and that every human born on this planet has the right to celebrate their humanity in any way they want, only then will we have succeeded in attaining a humane economy that can achieve human rights and societal innovation.","This is what happens when I smoke weed and angry type about Capitalism, feel free to enjoy the rant",0

So I started my job in September. I got hired as a Medicare sales agent. I studied for my license and passed the test. I go through training, everything seems great, they paid out a bunch of bonuses for on boarding and training performance. They make it out like we’re going to make a ton of money.

My state had some kind of computer issues which made my background check take like 8 weeks so my license didn’t come in time for the start of annual enrollment which is the biggest selling time of the year so they moved me to customer service with the promise that I could go back to sales when my license came in. I went from making $18 an hour in training to $12 an hour plus commission for selling up sells and stuff, which I totally sucked at.

I mean I’m kinda glad I didn’t just get canned with no backup but I was pretty butthurt about them changing my entire job on me and cutting my pay without even asking. I’m a human being not just a generic robot you can just plug in anywhere. I’m not good at everything.

Then, after I got my license and everything squared away, instead of putting me in sales, which was the job I applied for and was hired for, they put me in a different even shittier department because they “needed coverage.” So now they have me doing this god awful shit for $15 an hour where I’m just screening callers and transferring to agents.

It’s pretty horrible. My mouth is so dry and my voice is hoarse from talking nonstop (literally not enough time to breathe or take a drink of water before the next call) for 10 hours a day. (I forgot to mention all the mandatory overtime I didn’t agree to.) A lot of the callers are pissed because they get a million fucking calls this time of year and they think they’re all calling from the same place. Last week I was sexually harassed by a caller so bad I had to take 20 minutes to go cry. It was so foul.

I was so misled by this company I kinda feel like I’m in an abusive relationship. I was love bombed up front but then the real SQ rears it’s ugly head.

Oh and on top of that, Annual enrollment ends this week and I’m supposed to move to a different department AGAIN. Do I know what department I’m going to? ABSOLUTELY NOT. What’s up next on the wheel of bullshit? Nobody knows!

I have been applying to other jobs like crazy. I already have another offer. It’s for a similar company and I have no way of knowing if it’s going to be better or not but the interviewer said they prioritize preventing agent burnout and they are a much smaller company so maybe that’s a good sign.

TLDR: I was hired for a job that claimed I would make $70k and due to a licensing issue that was not my fault I have been moved departments several times, each more degrading than the last and now I’m getting $15 an hour to deal with abusive callers.",My job has moved me to a different (lower paying) department 3 times in 3 months.

But this job is very intense. I work in the assembly line, specifically the line with the newer more complicated bikes. We’re supposed to do our job in 5 minutes and 48 seconds and move onto the next bike, but it’s not enough time. The entire production line goes down very often just because somebody didn’t do their job in time. Stresses run high.

I could live with this, but we also have mandatory overtime. Not only are we told to come in an hour early from Monday to Thursday, but every other week we have to do an extra shift. So regular weeks are 44 hours and overtime weeks are 52 hours.

Yes the pay is good, but is it worth the stress of doing something you absolutely hate for such a long time? And because I work nightshift, what little time I have for friends and family I spend sleeping. I’ll go weeks without seeing somebody I actually love.

Also we don’t get any time off until we’ve been there a whole year. I’ve been there for 7 months now and I’m respected by the other employees. But if I have to take one more sick day, I’m going to be suspended without pay.

  Bottom line: I recently have put in my two weeks for a job that I had for about 2 months. Being a remote job, I worked out of my study turned office. The job was full of constant negative feedback through a computer screen, with no positive feedback whatsoever. Insufficient training, constant destructive criticism, constant blame for mistakes that weren't necessarily my fault (lack of training being the biggest reason), and unrealistic standards led to my anxiety going through the roof and the return of morbid ideation. 

  My family (who has been the one steady thing for me to hang onto) saw the spiral, and my wife told me to quit with no two weeks notice. Fearing the reprisal of a bad referral, I opted to give two weeks, even though I was questioning how I was going to keep going to the job that has been the worst job I've ever had.

  I feel like employers use the power of the bad references as a threat. I know that the power of reference is very much dependent on the company hiring. I've applied to companies that never asked for references. I've applied to companies that asked for references on the first page of the application. I guess I just don't want to screw my family's financial security because of one bad reference from a company that I worked at for two months.

 So I'm going to try to stick it out. I've applied for other jobs already, so if I get hired for one of those, I don't have to worry about it.

  I guess I just needed to get this out of my system for my sanity's sake and to get some validation for the frustration I feel. Also, if anyone has any tips to get through two weeks of a terrible job. Let me know.",Two week's notice rant,5

I think we Americans have been able to pretend things like our coffee cups and cream cheese just magically appear whenever we need them, instead of the reality: these products are made by underpaid workers, delivered by overburdened and overworked truckers, stocked by baristas and chefs not making a living wage. Many of these products are made overseas to exploit even cheaper labor, sometimes in countries that have been hit even harder by the pandemic than the US.

 I'm bitterly happy that it's impossible to ignore these dark realities of the consumerist society we live in, just as I am, in a dark way, pleased that it's impossible to ignore climate change now.

So I (21f) live with my partner (21m). We're both working as cashiers in a retail job. I've worked at 4 jobs prior and while each has been exhausting, this one feels.. moreso. I'm not sure if it's the actual job or just a decline in my mental health. I've always struggled with diagnosed depression and anxiety disorders. About a year and a half ago I got diagnosed with OCD and I was severely struggling, like to the point where I almost lost my partner, did lose my job (left one day due to panic attack and too embarrassed to return), and could barely do anything but sleep.

I finally took my OCD by the reins and started therapy with a specialist about a year ago. I got lucky enough to find someone who took my MediCal insurance. Well, about a month ago, my insurance changed due to moving and stopped covering our sessions. Now, if I'd like to continue the sessions, it is $100+ per session. Which I understand, she does a great job and it really has helped me. 

But financially, $100/wk is a lot. I'm a full time student and work about 30 hrs/week as well. I'm going to make it work somehow because I notice a serious decline in my mental health since being forced to stop. 

I guess where work ties into this is that I have noticed that being forced to work just to survive, rent a place, have food, all of this really contributes to by depression and anxiety. I'n so much happier when I'm at home, and have more time to eat well, exercise, spend time with my partner and cats, relax, meditate. 

Working makes me so tired it feels impossible to brush my teeth or drink water. The entire time I feel so sad and depressed and just exhausted. And people are so mean to retail workers. My body hurts from standing all day (I live in the U.S., no chairs.) I wake up in pain and by the end of the day, regardless of shoes, my feet feel like they are on fire. Also, I have IBS, and working seems to trigger anxiety which triggers IBS. And yes, I an currently looking for a job, but honestly, everything here that I qualify for, bring a student with no degree yet, it's all the same. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone here has any advice on coping with working and balancing mental health. Especially people who have been working a lot longer than me, at 21. The idea of forever trying to balance my mental health an having to work scares and depresses me.

Accepting a four-day work-week is accepting that work should take priority over life.

A four-day work-week isn't work-life balance. We are so used to 5 days or more of work that we are conditioned to believe it is. The 32-hour work-week is essentially a scam.

Really we shouldn't even be aiming for work-life balance. Because that assumes that work and life should be evenly balanced. No, we should be aiming for maximum life, minimum work.

BRUH.

Private school: better access to exam prep, college consideration, better resources for entrance exams

Zero fucking loans: no stress about failure you can easily retry; you can get the BARE MINIMUM in GPA and whatever entrance exam you need because mommy and daddy will pay for the costs;

tutors and exam supplements: NO fucking hard logic to see this, if you can pay for whatever the FUCK you need to do better than the poor kids who cant pay for it, you automatically get grade inflation over everyone else, and YES, you have to work LESS HARD than everyone else who doesnt have this advantage

Job access: family connections getting you a job means you DONT need to try as hard, your stress is lower during classes so you honestly can just have an easier time learning, all you need to do is pass because you wont end up on the FUCKING STREET if you fail one time. You are HANDED-ECONOMIC-SUCCESS with near ZERO chance of failing.

I went to a private undergrad school that i had to beg for scholarship to be able to afford, which helped me beg for scholarships to hve a shot at reasonable debt in graduate school.

I had to give up going to class for 8 weeks just to do enough job interviews so when i graduated i didnt become homeless.  I then had to take finals and catch up.

Walked in the fucking rain to get anywhere.

And i DONT have family wealth helping me, so i dont get to walk around spending all my money for having fun, i have to save nearly all of it right now.

Yet being around southern rich kids: they got pushed through the system and were handed jobs. it was like high school to them. Their success was guarenteed if they put in minimum fucking effort. and they walk around my work and friend groups thinking that average people dont work hard. average people shouldnt be trusted for policy. average people are ""not at any disadvantage getting through education , i dont agree ""   


Dude, i asked where you lived, and you openly said you stayed in your famlies: SPARE - THREE STORY - BUILDING. I stayed in near a shack with 4 people and came out 20,000 in debt.

Yeah buddy. we understand. you are such a delicate little flower that you dont want to admit that having every major struggle paid away in your path gave you inflated success in : job searching, exam taking, learning in class, OH WAIT YOU WERE HANDED THIS JOB from a friend of the family!

I wouldn't have any problem with some wealth inequality, i frankly dont care when I talk to someone . But for them to begin talking about how their wealth doesnt give them a massive advantage over someone who cannot fail....How being able to buy THOUSANDS in exam supplements and tutors during the year isnt going to give them higher grades compared to someone who can only spend 1/10 that....

To have that person make the joke ""oh well i got better grades than you i must be smarter"".

BRUH. You got this job because mommy and daddy handed you every advantage in the book. I had to scrap buy and earn every scholarship, and pull off living on under 5,000 a YEAR.

Im sorry this is random and long and makes no sense, guys im sorry.

But being around entitled rich kids who have had life handed to them, who then turn around and begin talking about how ""my money didnt give me any advantages, poverty does nothing"", and ""african americans were never denied access to economic success, you can pay to have any study or poll to say anything, history is whatever the teller wants to argue"".

It feels so ....it feels like they believe they are BETTER because mommy and daddy handed them success...and im lesser because despite getting the same job , they got slightly better success despite me having none of the resources.

NEWSFLASH: If you grew up in private schools, with no chance of loans, with no loans on the housing you needed to pay for in undergrad and college, with cars handed to you , with exam supplements that cost thousands upon thousands of dollars handed to you, AND your grades didnt matter because mommy and daddy got you a job: You not only had an advantage, YOU HAD NEARLY EVERY BIT of your success HANDED to you, with your contribution accounting for MAYBE 5%. The ONLY THING you NEEDED to do was to not FUCK IT UP, thats it!

So get off your high horse.

Your MILLIONS guranteed your success.

You LITERALLY told me during exam season you had no classes for a week, so you went to FUCKING MEXICO to relax on a beach, while I had to work a side job and study for exams.

In short, my responsibilities are to do videography/photography/editing/light graphic design/ and some pr/copywriting.

I make 28.06 an hour, or  $58364.8 gross; this is the most I've ever made in my life. But I'm also at my most miserable.

I came in right before the pandemic started and didn't really get any proper training (and this was noted in my most recent performance review). Between having a coworker, my boss, and ***their*** boss leaving during the pandemic, I've absorbed responsibilities and my job description is written in a way that I don't know where my responsibilities end and the others begin.

My bosses' position has been open for a year. My co-workers' position was removed from the organization chart entirely (they were the **dedicated** graphic design guy and supplementary photographer). Hell, my position was open for over a year (before the pandemic). My boss's boss's position was recently filled, and we'll see if there are changes.

My \*acting\* supervisor has standards that sometimes aren't very realistic and they're very outspoken about me not living up to them. He doesn't seem to be a bad person at heart...but I have a hard time caring. He drives me crazy.

And to top it all off, I'm finding a hard time caring about anything.  I try, but I find most of it mind-numbingly disinteresting. I keep being told, ""Go find things happening around the District that you think are interesting!"" Kids are great. I love 'em! Hope to have some of my own one day. But this never really feels about the kids. It basically feels like bullshit PR/News stuff (no offense to anyone in those fields), there's very little room to be creative. I've literally been told on multiple occasions, ""We've gotta get our story out before the news stations do."" Why are we competing with them? If we want to put out fun and compelling stories, why do I have to rush to beat the 4 o'clock news? Our context of delivery should be different.

One thing that always comes up at Christmas (at least where I am) is Santa's ""Naughty or Nice"" list. Every December, my parents used this as a threat when I was really little. If I cried, didn't do what I was told, asked too many questions... on the naughty list I went. And I would anxiously fret about how I could possibly suck up to my parents enough to get back on the nice list (except, like a lot of parents at the time, discipline was focused on the bad and not the good; when the list was brought up, kids were rarely on the Nice List, but only told they would have to see, or if they were good they would be), and I don't think anyone ever said to me or my siblings, ""You must be on Santa's Nice List!"" after doing the right thing or doing extra,  showing kindness, etc. And truth be told, not just because of this but a lot of factors, I spent my childhood and teen years, and to a much lesser extent my twenties (but not at work), as a people pleasing doormat bent on never getting people I'd have to see regularly upset. 

I don't love Christmas, but after I had kids, I really made the effort.  They LOVE it, and that makes me happy.  As they got older,  other adults and even older kids in the family would bring out that phrase once December hit, (please read this in a shakey grandma voice) ""Be good or you'll go on the Naughty List!"". 

I would cringe every time I heard it. My partner wasn't as weirded out by it, but he also never said it. My older child was visibly affected by this, not in the same way I was, but there was something brewing, a bit of shame that he was a ""bad kid"".

That Christmas passed, and the next came.  Someone gifted them a ""Santa cam"", and told them Santa was ALWAYS watching them. Privately, I told the kids that just wasn't realistic. So they used it instead to send messages to Santa and that was fine.

And then! It happened. We were at a family Christmas Eve gathering. My oldest was playing in the basement, having fun. An older family member said they wanted some drinks that were in their vehicle. They aren't super mobile, so obviously,  someone would go get them. The other adult, instead of walking the twenty steps out the door to get the drinks said, ""I'll make one of the kids do it!"". My kid must have been the first in sight, and he said, ""Hey, *kids name*! Go out to so and so's car and get the drinks in the back."" 
Now, my kid just isn't a good listener,  as in, he's not good at paying attention. If you want his attention, it's easier to go right up to him, he isn't listening to the background noise. This doesn't offend me personally, but I'm his mother. But it DID offend the adult who was talking to him from the top of the basement stairs. 

I heard him shout down, ""Oh man! I'm telling your Mom you're on the Naughty List now!"" Why he thought I would personally care is beyond me, but my kid was still either ignoring him or absorbed in his own thing, so he shouted to me in a totally different room  ""Hey *my name*, did you know *kids name* is on the NAUGHTY LIST!?""

This my kid did hear, and he was a little upset, ""I'm not getting presents!? Why? I didn't hear you! I wasn't listening, I'm sorry!"" practically groveling to this adult. I was on my way and when I saw my kids face, just filled with dread, and the adults face smirking, that was it for me. 

I ignored the other adult and told my kid in front of everyone else's kid that The Naughty List was just something adults made up to make kids listen. And that Santa knows that everyone makes mistakes and is usually trying their best, and why would other people get to decide if kids were on Santa's Naughty List, how did that make sense? 

That's a fuck-it mode reaction that I don't think anyone should copy me on, but never again will I let adults tell my kids about the Naughty List, or that Santa is watching them, etc. I refuse to raise my kids to be scared of getting in trouble with ""the big boss"" if they don't slave for the middle-managers (adults). 

This is really what the Christmas/Santa dynamic boils down to in my part of the world: people slaving to make gifts, and others slaving to afford gifts; all the while following fake folk traditions assimilated by the corporations to ensure people would get stuck in a slave and consume rat race to please their children.

We still celebrate Christmas and wait for Santa, but I hope when my kids are older I can have conversations about these traditions with them, and they'll feel comfortable straying even further from the capitalist propaganda with their own traditions if they want to. 

Anyways, that's my beginning of December rant, thank-you. Writing this down and remembering that Christmas has me even more determined this year to fill my kids with joy during the holiday season, and not allow any other adults to shame them for whatever behaviors they determine would get the boss 🎅 upset.

Also, if these are things you adhere to, I don't necessarily think that's wrong, it's just wrong for me and my kids. Do what works for you. Parenting is hard.",Not allowing other adults &amp; corporations to shame my children at Christmas. Rant. Anti-work for kids.,32

I'm 24, went to college and did well.

Regardless of that revelation, I was able to use my varied skills and background to get jobs (I studied technical theater, which is a mix of artistic and technical skills and a lot of them are transferable to other fields). I also had the advantage of my mom who worked in corporate for 20+ years, and was one time an HR rep. She really understood what hiring managers were looking for so she taught me every trick in the book about writing cover letters and interviewing. The downside to this is that she has a very old school way of looking at the working world and being professional. This isn't necessarily bad, I just learned to adjust her methods for the modern world. She's even starting to learn a little bit about it too because she's a high school teacher now.

ANYWAY my point in saying all this is that I know how to play the game really well. But, with the recent pandemic and ""the great resignation"" and ""labor shortages"" and what have you, it's become really clear to me that the way I was taught to look at working life and career development is no longer relevant. This being: get a job, be really good at it, make bank, etc.

So, if that's not it, then what is it?

I know people make a bigger deal out of work and status than it needs to be, so I'm trying very hard to put that idea out of my mind, that I need to compare myself to others work life. But, I do need to make money, and I can't just sit around all the time. I'm bored as hell. I have no idea what I want to do or what I want to proceed with. But I hate the typical 9-5. I can't decide if I like more physical work or problem solving kinds of work. I'm FANTASTIC with kids and know I would be one of the best teachers ever, but American public education is a mine field right now and for my own mental sanity I'm not going anywhere near it.

I went to trade school to get that diploma and I work in nursing homes. I love the job itself. I love caring for your grannies and grampies. I love the crazy shit dementia people say and I love knowing that I’m there for them to comfort them in their last days. 

With that said, I hate it. I’m tired of chronically understaffed. I’m tired of having to be a traveler to make decent money. I’m tired of having CNAs who will literally work 7 16hr shifts in a row. I hate seeing the forced neglect bc of staffing. And I hate hate HATE seeing them pretend it’s only recent bc of Covid. 

In truth, nursing has been hurting for a while. As an LPN, I don’t make as much as RNs. Before I started traveling I was making $18/hr to care for 30patients with hopefully 3 aids. Make good money now. I work 4 12s a week, but like I shouldn’t have to do this. Seeing the country is cool but seeing my family more than 1-2 weeks a year is cooler. Finding new camping spots is cool but having close bonds is cooler. I’m in my 30s and would really like to have a man and settle down and have a kid, but it’s hard to date seriously when the absolute maximum I can stay in one place is a year. 


Everyone should be concerned. Nursing is necessary. It’s is absolutely one of the most needed jobs in the world. However, no one cares how we struggle. A large portion of society calls us careless when we ask for more money. They say we are horrible nurses bc we “shouldn’t be in it for the money.” We allow people to work 60+ hrs a week with no regrets. Don’t even get me started on the absolute and literal) shit CNAs have to deal with. Everyone claims we neglect patients yet tell us “it’s the job” when we say we absolutely have to have more help in order for these patients to have more dignity. Instead, inspectors come in and “tag” us on our inevitable failures. The only solution is audits (the stating at us while we struggle) and more paperwork to fill out. 


As much as I love being a nursing home nurse, I can’t do this forever but I can’t imagine stopping traveling just to barely speak by. So now I’m doing what I can to improve my finances, save as much as I can since I’m making good money right now. Then I’m gonna go home, by some land and start working toward opening a campground in a beautiful slice of TN. 

I don’t want to come off as vein, but I’m the nurse you want to care for your loved ones….. but bc of capitalism I can’t.

I watched it and was baffled at the points made in the video and how defensiv of Tesla the creator. So I looked at some other videos on Youtube and read some articles. The videos were all the pro Tesla the articles more neutral. To the points the enraged me.

Firstly was how IG Metall was framed as the bad guy that just wants to protect the german companies from the foreign Tesla, so IG Metall bullies Tesla.

Which I don't even doubt that is to small piece true but how is this bulling when the consesquence of is that Tesla is handled like every other german autombile factory and if IG Metall succeeds the workers will most likey have better working conditions and benefits.

Secondly the lies/misinformation about german unions that if the worker were unionizing they can't be paid more then the union standard and the worse benfits.

I don't know a single union here that would stop a company from doing more for there workers.

Thirdly that Tesla would themself a good job to get their workers the best they deserve.

The track record of many other companys shows that they give a shit about their workers and even if Tesla was the exception(which it isn't) why should one make exception for just one compan.

Fourth fourthly ? they sat the union and germany were anti enviornment because Tesla produces electric cars and that is good for the environment.

USA, a will to work state. (Also I'm on phone after a grave shift, so apologies if there's typos/errors)

Also, a brief note on leadership chain because I know some businesses differ, it goes employee&gt;team lead&gt;supervisor&gt;manager. There's stuff beyond that, but that's as far as it goes.

I came in early for my shift simply because with short staff, they are lax on OT. As any employee, I got the general direction of what tasks to prioritize from the previous shift, who happens to be a supervisor. This supervisor is aware of his job security in a salary position, so regularly clock's out way earlier than he should after doing as little work as he can manage. 

He relays to me several really large tasks, any one of them would take the full grave shift to complete. I'm frustrated, with his reputation it's fairly clear he likely looked at how much work there was and went ""well, tonight's the night we have two employees on graves, so I just won't worry about it.""

Other employee comes in, (and I am experienced enough I am aiming to get a team lead position and move up so I take charge when needed. I got bills to pay.) So I relay all the tasks to him. I suggested we each focus on one project and he agreed.

We both did excellent. I was able to complete one task, and take a significant chunk out of another big one. These were tasks that typically have an hour or two dedicated to them each shift (day, swing, grave) and nobody had worked on it in weeks. To get as much completed as I did is a big accomplishment, especially I'm a single night. The other employee also essentially got the work done for two employees. I'm aware I'm hyping myself up, but it should absolutely be acknowledged that he accomplished a huge work load on his own.

Next shift comes in in the morning, a team lead. I take charge and let him know what all we accomplished and he was impressed. With how nights had left work the last few weeks (me recovering from surgery, other employee  on holiday, leaving aforementioned supervisor to cover the grave ), he was relieved to see that while there was still a lot to do, there was a significant dent in what he would need to start on. 

Team lead leaves area to prep for his shift, and manager comes in wanting stuff relayed to them. I start with what I got done, giving my ""here's the work, and here's what I was able to accomplish..."" and she cuts me off,

""Oh, you both did all that?"" 

I just assume that it was misheard, so start to correct ""well, that's what I was able to do, I also started...""

""Oh that's great all you guys got that done last night.""

It seemed a deliberate way to distribute credit for the work I completed to everyone. A way to disavow my achievements and steps to promotion, and instead lock me in my position. Very disheartening. 

I didn't finish what I was saying,  so I didn't get to where I was going to also state what the other employee accomplished. I was very offput. 

I roommate with a team lead so I relayed the situation to her, just feeling worried it was deliberate and I should be looking for work.

She tells me that the manager participated in a nationwide zoom (or similar) meeting where one of the things they put a lot of emphasis on was steering away from anything that could be perceived as favoritism, and one of the major ways to do so that they directed on how to employ was to accredit tasks, and thus accomplishments, to the whole team. These were directed by individuals significantly higher than the manager, and despite it being a called meeting, it was essentially a classroom that did not invite questions. 

Admittedly this next part is vague assumptions, but she said these decision makers are 250k salary types who never work on lower levels and never need to worry about trying to move up, so why should they bother acknowledging individuals. 

Pardon the rant, it's just exhausting.

Now everybody, even my closest friend at work and mom is saying that I'm wrong and no matter where I work, i'll be treated like shit and I have to apologize. At home my mom went insane about it and we had a huge fight.
Little details: I'm throught depression right now for a while, having huges thoughts about giving up about everything and trying so hard to no do so.

Also, i did not listed everything i had to endure or listen trought months since it was already long as fck.
Right now, I literally going back to apologize because I have given a few days to leave home (mom insane rage) and i need the money.

So why do I hate my job? Well I get payed minimum wage with a lot of work load. Callcenter work is hard because of the people you can get on your phone. The government makes making appointment just too complicated really. I’m currently making appointments for people who are above 80 years old.

But what kind of rules make it really difficult? Well first of all we need to have the person on the phone to make the appointment, it wouldn’t be hard if it were young people but the current age demographic it’s always yelling at the phone because they can’t hear or they ramble all kind of things because they forget what we’re asking. So basically their kids always call us, but we always have to say “no sorry we really need to have the person on phone no matter the age”. This rule really screws us over because now almost every conversation is about their kids yelling, cussing and complaining about us.

Second thing is we have to read a script out loud, now I know everything about the scrip out of my head but everyone basically sounds like a robot and we have tell people so many things that at the end of the phone when they forget to hang up they say “I already know all this shit damn why are telling us so much things”. Even moving an appointment we have to do this over and over again. It just doesn’t make sense. We get told that it is important because we’re doing something important. Well shit I guess nobody knows that you have to wear a mask and keep distance after 2 years of COVID.

Btw our phone calls get tapped and judged. Forget to name a tiny thing? Well your score drops by a ton and you have to hear the bullshit from your supervisor.

Our chat is really toxic at the moment, a lot of people are asking for a raise on chat because or work load is too much. That we need to change rules to make everything smoother for us and the caller but they just don’t fucking listen. They tell us they take feedback but the amount of complaints we all write down only make the rules stricter. 

This company also has webinars, what I really don’t get is why a lot of people are asskissing this company. They send messages that they are grateful and really love their job, but outside of the webinar the only thing I see is people ranting, telling other people that their throat is soar that it is too busy.

Also our bathroom breaks don’t get payed and we constantly need to pick up calls. In fact we don’t get to pick up phone they are directly connected to us. So no breaks between calls either, we’re nonstop talking. 

This job is breaking me, I have a nonstop headache for 5 days straight and the stress is getting to my head. I can’t sleep good anymore because my heart beats so fast that I’m fully awake. Mind you that I am healthy and regularly work out. The only times where I can sleep is when I see my partner in the weekend.",Rant about current work situation,6

One of my collegues who I have been in college with since undergrad studies recomended me to a company she worked with previously but left as I was competent in IT stuff. I sent in a resume and got called for an interview and was accepted. We discussed salary and I guess due to inexperience I lowballed my self as the interviewer asked if I was willing to lower the salary by 500 dollars. I agreed as I was getting married the following year and needed a job. Initially it was a 6 month probation and then reevaluation process to become a permanent employee. first 6 months were fine. No issues aside from tardyness as i had no vehicle and transport for me was an issue. Working hours were from  from 8 to 430. i usually reached around 820 but i stayed until 5 so that i put in my hours.  Eventually it was pushed to 830 to 5 to facilitate me better after i was made permanent. No salary increase as they said my performance was not worthy of a salary increase. I said ok fine fair enough. 2017 nothing 2018 nothing no salary increases no bonuses. I use my vehicle for company duties, checking in on Saturdays when systems go down. no bonus no extra time. still I said nothing. I started thinking that i must be some kinda horrible employee. 3 years and I am still on my probation salary. 2019 i had my first child. Pregnancy was horrible. Wife was vomiting every morning making getting to work on time a chore. She had several fibroids and the doc said they were in some complicated areas and the pregnancy was a high risk. I started reaching late again but always gave my time. Eventually HR called me in to have a ""talk"" I was there with HR manager Senior HR person and My Manager. I explained my side and the doctors side. I  explained that I have to drive my wife to one location through horrid traffic and then come back down the road and go back through some traffic again to get to my location as the doc banned her from driving and I was not letting her travel. HR Manager said her GF has fibroids and does be running and doing all kinds of physical activity and she said it with a smile as well. I knew then and there they already made up their mind that i was getting my warning letter. When i opened it up and saw the print out of the times late they were arguing about 5 mins 10 mins when you watch my time clocked out half hour after 1 hour after. When I have to go through that traffic to service the other locations with my personal vehicle with out added compensation all that I wanted to tell them about and be like ok so all these instances of me doing this counts for  nothing in your eyes? I wanted to say it so bad but was like I have a kid on the way let me humble my self. Karma will sort it out.  Took my warning letter did my best and still came late cause what else they gonna do. Aftet that i started actively looking for jobs. 2021 came and my second child was born. Same pregnancy issues same tardyness issues but we in a global pandemic and I'm a FrontLine Hero aparently. Still no Salary increase. I was like ok if no Salary increase or a 5 year bonus quit the job and spend  time looking. My 5 year work anniversary was 2nd August 2021. I got nothing from work , no email from HR saying thank you for 5 years of service no thank you for continuing to go above and beyond. I was like fuck it. Asked my wife permission to leave the job and find a new one at the end of 2021. Applied like hell all over the place and on Aug 30th I got an interview and by September 6th I was in my new job. Did not give any 2 week notice. Did my resignation letter on the 1st Sept and told em My last day would be 3rd Sept as I would be required to start on the following monday. My supervisor and some other coworkers I could tell were genuinely happy for me. Manager not so much. They were asking me to give 1 month notice for a ""Proper Handover"" LMFAO. Who am I handing over to. No body works under me. I turned in my co id and co phone and walked out that friday so happy. Sorry for the long story but I just read some of you guys stories and i felt like sharing. Some companies looking for Slaves rather than employees. I still thanked them for Giving me a chance when no one would and I am grateful but they have to learn to treat employees like people and understand people have issues.",Rant about an experience With HR and my first warning letter that led me to start job hunting and to my new job,15

This happened a few days ago. I work in HR (I know, fuck me, but I hate it and I'm trying to make a change) for a small company. Part of my job is administering the FMLA leave of absence process. When an employee is out on a leave for their own medical condition, there are forms that need to be filled out by a doctor in order for us to document the need for leave and also make sure that they can come back to work with/without reasonable accommodations.

Well, inevitably, this guy at work gets Covid, so he obviously calls out sick. Since it's clear he is going to be out for over a week or so, we prepare the necessary paperwork for him and send it over to him explaining what is required of him. He then doesn't answer for several days, so obviously we are getting concerned.

Finally, we hear from him after him ghosting us for a while, and turns out he was in the hospital with covid pneumonia. We tell him we hope he is recovering, and that he can get the paperwork completed by his doctor in a few days when he's feeling better. 

Days go by and we don't hear from him. Finally, he texts me (on a Saturday btw) asking me to call him. When I call, he starts cursing and screaming at me over the phone, telling me that he doesn't have a primary care physician and that the urgent care and the hospital he was at won't fill out the FMLA paperwork for him and that he doesn't know what to do. 

But here's the part that angered me. He goes on to accuse me of intentionally putting him and his family in harms way by making him go out to an urgent care to try and get these forms completed while ""there's all this covid around out there and (he's) got young children at home."" 

Now mind you, this guy was already infected and he's not vaccinated for no legitimate reason. The virus was already brought into his home by him. Not me or anyone else. It's also not my fault he doesn't bother to have a primary care physician. I know he has decent health insurance. And again, this dick is NOT VACCINATED for NO LEGITIMATE REASON, and he had the audacity to accuse ME of putting his family in harms way! He did that himself!

So as HR I'm obviously supposed to be all political and not let my personal opinions influence my work, but this antivax asshole suggesting that I put his family in harm's way was just too much. I was seeing red at this point. I told him ""well, you're the one who chose not to get vaccinated for no reason, right? But you have the nerve to accuse ME of putting your family in danger??  As far as I can tell, you've already done that yourself, so take responsibility for your own decisions"" Then I hung up on him. 

Anyways, I didn't end up getting in trouble, but I'm looking for a new job now. Preferably not in HR. I don't need that bullshit in my life. My boss did tell me to apologize to this guy for what I said, but that's not gonna happen. Fuck him.",Antivax Bullshit at Work (Rant),8

My new job is a stark contrast to what I experienced. Deprogramming from what I had been used to has been eye opening to say the least. It’s hard to wrap my head around how completely unhappy and distressed that I was. Even typing the words out is hard, so I apologize if this seems choppy, and it will probably be long. I feel like I need to share my experiences, what my work environment is like now, and how my life as a whole had been affected. 

Past company (QA analyst, then sales):
* Scolded for asking for OT pay when I worked OT (“We’re all a team here.”)
* Written up for having a conversation with a coworker about their partner’s pay and benefits (“We want to keep an environment of trust here.”)
* Directed to lie and mislead current and potential clients about software bugs, features, size of support teams, location, etc
* Banned from having tools needed for half of job responsibilities (client support) when working from home, then scolded for not “doing my part,” despite practically begging for said tools
* Continually bullied and used as punching bag for leadership. It was “acceptable” though because they apologized and acknowledged that I didn’t deserve it, but I was just “so nice,” it was easier for them to be mean
* Coerced to bring my child into to office when they were sick so that I could still work
* Coerced to drive in dangerous conditions to go to the office (and again, bring my child), despite the city being shut down and in a declared state of emergency 
* Having to ask permission to leave my desk to go to the restroom
* Having to outline exact details about PTO requests (what, when, where, why, how, etc)
* When working as their sole sales executive, was not allowed to know pricing of products or see contracts
* Never given commission contract during 8+ months in role, and when I asked for metrics to be defined so that I could understand my pay, told it was too hard and impossible, and they would pay what they believed I deserved/earned
* …I could go on

I already suffer from several mental illnesses (PTSD and ADHD, among others), but this job had me spiraling. I was completely suicidal, and the only thing that kept me alive was the fact that I was a single parent. My physical health was also abysmal - I was gaining weight, my skin was awful, my hair was falling out, smoking weed nightly to self-medicate, etc. 

These things SHOULD NOT BE NORMAL. People shouldn’t be crying in the bathroom, closet, cars, wherever, daily because of a job. People’s mental health should not be on the line because of a job. People should not have to tolerate being bullied and abused because of a job. Your children should not have to suffer because of a job. 

Nobody deserves that. 

When I was offered this new position, I cried from relief. Not only because the actual pay and benefits were much better, but because from the beginning, it was a company that treated me like an actual human. 

Current company (sales role):
* First interview with hiring manager was a normal, casual conversation. We talked shit about our different sports teams, discussed life experiences, expectations between the company and employees, etc. Truly an enjoyable experience, and he was amazing to work for. (He left for his dream job shortly after, but was connected to it and encouraged by the CEO to go!) 
* Respect and encouragement of boundaries. If I do not have the bandwidth for a task, I am able to either deprioritize other tasks, or I can decline to do it
* Respect and encouragement of personal time. I took an entire week off for Thanksgiving, and will take off two weeks for Christmas, at the encouragement of my director. When I offered to bring my  laptop with me (because of my own feelings of guilt), I was told not to, because “holidays are for family.”
* Sales metrics and expectations are clear. I’m allowed to create my own calendar and manage my time to meet those. If I can get my work for the day done in 3 hours, then I’ll only work 3 hours. 
* Profit sharing and company/team bonuses for meeting or exceeding goals
* Monthly evaluations of company and leadership, and addressing shortcomings following 
* Healthy competition, resource sharing, idea swaps, and team encouragement from sales organization
* Company mission isn’t just words. It’s put to work, from employees to clients. 
* True coaching from leadership, with tools, resources, and training given to make improvements
* …I could go on

The difference in my mental and physical health is night and day. Because work revolves around my life now, I can take time to take care of myself. I can go to the gym, go to therapy, take myself to the doctor, eat healthier because I have the time to cook, etc. I can actually spend quality time with my family. If my child sick, I can take care of them. My hair and skin are healthier. I’ve lost 25 pounds and counting. I can drive on an overpass and not think about launching myself over the bridge. I actually look forward to and like my job - I’m crushing goals and being recognized for it, and as a result, being trusted with our largest accounts. 

Everything in my life has improved, and it’s not just because of pay. This is how it SHOULD be. 

If you don’t have it, find it. Demand it. Life isn’t about the rat race or hamster wheel.

You deserve that for yourself.",Deprogramming from a toxic work environment: A rant and revelation,13

I said thank you and I thought that was the end of the parking space drama right? It was sorted and I thanked the lady who helped me.

I then got a phone call from my supervisor saying he has ""multiple"" emails from people saying I was complaining and demanded a parking spot and he also tells me this could affect my probation period and I probably won't get hired. This supervisor also told me that I am not disabled enough for a disability parking spot even though I have a permit that I had to apply for in order to get it. 

I was in tears cause he absolutely made me feel like such a burden on  everyone because of my disability. I almost quit the job right there and then a guardian angel came over and asked me what was wrong so I tell her the whole story and she is in shock she immediately grabbed another supervisor and I told the supervisor what happened. Turns out it's discrimination towards my disability. It was so scary and I already feel bad enough for being disabled and having people to constantly accommodate for me.
My guardian angel has vouched for me to say I never demanded a parking spot and I didn't bad mouth the company in a work environment. 

Turns out the supervisor who told me off has been reported to his boss and she rips him a new one this was turned into such a big thing it got up to the CEO of the company and he was pissed. The supervisor didn't get fired but he is no longer my supervisor. 

It all eventually worked out but it's put me completely on edge anytime I talk or ask for help in the office.

I dream for retirement and hopefully living until I'm super old (my disability is terminal but there's a possibility I could live a long and happy life)

In recent memory, the predominant culture was ""it's better to ask for forgiveness, than permission"", where a handful of ""rogue"" departments always insisted on doing things their own way, rather than the way the rest of us had to do things.

Well here we are, a year and a half into working from home with a drastically downsized staff. It's basically down to 2 departments driving the business, and a couple of small support teams. We got a new leader last year and part of the new culture that developed was ""never say no"". 

This is just about the stupidest business strategy I've ever heard of in my life.

Leaders and upper mgmt who have NFC how things actually work make decisions with long reaching ramifications, and apparently now we're not allowed to say ""hell no that's batshit crazy because x,y,z"". 

Instead, we are being ""challenged"" to not say no, and to come up with innovative ways to say ""yes"". 

Can you guess where I'm going with this?

This has led to a a new culture of everyone just ignores any unpleasant ask, or anything where the answer has to be no. 

I hate being ignored! To me it is extremely unprofessional! I would much rather get a ""no"" response (even without an explanation) than NO RESPONSE AT ALL.

Example from this morning. We used to take direction from Team A, but now we take direction from Team B. Team A asked me why we weren't doing something, so I asked my contact at team B, are we going to do this?

There were days when I've worked till 12-1-2 at a stretch and not complained either. Now, as a part of my transition duty, I have to train and support a new joiner. I have been training the person, provided the recording of the training and have been on continuous calls with her since morning till night. 

Yesterday, I logged out at 6.30 (and I login at 9.30 daily). Post which, my senior started whatsapping me (at 7.00 PM) on my personal number asking me to login since some team had sent a file to us. I didn't reply since I was done for the day. After this, the senior started calling me at 8.00 PM. 


In today morning's meeting, I was told:

""You need to be available to support the new joiner."" 

""If you are so strict about your work timings, let us tell you know that we log in at 10 and logout by 3.""

""You need to inform before you logout so that if there is any work we will give it you."" 

When I claimed that post 6.30 is my personal time and I have people at home, I was told:

""Even we have personal commitments and even we have people at home. If there is any emergency you can then logout early.""

Their definition of on-time is early and by emergency I assume they meant that when someone is about to die, I can be excused but otherwise, work should be my priority and not my personal time.

TL;DR version: my brainwashed ass has finally realized antiwork is the way. 

My folks instilled work ethic into me, and I value it to this day, but it wasn’t until recently how much I mistook slavery for “work ethic”. 

The halcyon days: I quit my “real job” to follow my passion to be a dog trainer. Some of my training experience there over the years: service dogs who have saved my clients’ lives from dangerous seizures and diabetic comas, police K9 handlers to maintain better relationships and control with their dogs, dogs that sniffed out bombs and dangerous narcotics, bodyguards to advance their careers and get their K9 certification. I traveled (and still travel) the United States, competing in the most challenging dog sports involving tracking, obedience and protection.

Unfortunately when the pandemic hit, our specialty business took a hit and we couldn’t keep the lights on. Because we could make more in unemployment, the boss shut down operations and cut me a six month severance, a glowing review, and a friendship that lasts today.

The shit job: I took work at a daycare facility that also offered boarding and training. They wanted my help as well with training staff, since they had such a high turnover rate and no one was experienced there. (Side note: daycares are recipes for disaster and don’t take your dog to one.) Per my contract I got commission and monthly bonuses on sales. It took me a couple months to hit my bonus numbers, but once I had I was back to a livable wage.

Per my job description, I scheduled time with the employees (and marked it on my calendar) to improve their skills, help them feel more confident in a room full of 30 animals, and reduced a lot of injuries. But the site manager kept up with the bullshit staffing practices, kept allowing dangerous animals into the yard (because they’re repeat customers) against my multiple and written recommendations not to. Of course I had to call the customer and tell them about the fights. 

Finally they hired another trainer at a different location. She was okay. Most of her experience was working at a zoo in the reptile area, and teaching music classes. She buddies up with the CEO and convinces him there needed to be a director to the training department, who of course was her. Mind you, she had a fat golden retriever who couldn’t do shit, and a highly reactive dog who was excused as “just being a corgi”. Meanwhile my Malinois and Dutch shepherds can be handled by even the most inexperienced of staff safely, and have multiple working titles. 

First red flag: She printed out a new job description for me that took away my bonus pay. She doesn’t make sales or train so her entire paycheck is taken out of my sales and bonus. I pulled out my contract when I joined and said she couldn’t, but she explained since the job title was different it would be different pay. I put them side-by-side and showed her she had added responsibilities, didn’t take any away, for less pay. I told her I’d give her my lunch break to figure it out or I wouldn’t come back. She backed down and I kept my pay. I should have quit anyway. 

Short form of other bullshit: 
* I had to be out 3 weeks with COVID that I got at work. She “covered” my overnight  dogs and left me to explain to the customer why there was 0 improvement. Had to refund the customer, which was taken out of my commission, even though she “trained” the dog. 
* She frequently left dangerous dogs loose in rooms with apprentice staff because the dog would be “more comfortable” without leash and collar. Two members of staff were bit, in one case even the owners couldn’t get the dog to return and she had to grab it with a catch pole. 
* She forced me to train according to her rubric instead of my experience. I pointed out that this was no different than Petsmart training but we charge thousands of dollars. I was to do it anyway. 
* I was, multiple times, instructed NOT to train my overnight dogs the minimum 1 hour per day even though we explicitly tell the customers we do this and sign contracts to that effect. I was encourage to have up to 15 dogs at a time: for an 8 hour shift that includes consults and lessons. 
* I was frequently and in writing instructed to prioritize sales at the expense of product, because the managers “could talk upset customers off the cliff with a free night of boarding”. 

The revelation: She fired me. After hiring a bunch of teenagers for her training department at minimum wage, she fired me so she wouldn’t have to share my bonus pay in her fraud factory. I didn’t say a word to her, she kept trying to engage with me but I packed all my gear, apologized to my coworkers who gave a damn, and left her mid-sentence with her bullshit severance letter.

Looking back, I’m ashamed. I’m crying writing this. I did absolutely everything she asked. I jumped through every hoop. Worst of all, I went against my moral code to serve what I took as “work ethic”. I scammed the members of my own community out of thousands of dollars just because my manager said we’d have to close if I didn’t. 

I hate her. She’s the only person in the world I hate in this way. I hope she dies. People like her are actually evil, and I’m disgusted with myself for the role I played in it.",Antiwork awakening (rant),29

Well now its to the point that if one person is out the whole schedule goes to shit, people dont get breaks on time or sometimes at all except for the legally required lunch break, and customers are angry because theres nobody available to help them and those that are are the cashiers who dont know where anything is thanks to a remodel and a lack of communication from management. Work has become a huge source of stress for me, it went from something I enjoyed to something that I dread every day, this is also made worse by the fact that Im a closeted pre transition trans girl in a very conservative area, so that adds to my stress on top of that because I have to keep it together and keep a happy face all day every day even though internally Im screaming.

In early February of 2020 I was working for a local commercial furniture dealership. I had been there as a contractor and then employee for about 10 years. I started to notice that the equipment (trucks and vans) that we needed were in worsening states of disrepair. Some trucks and vans were outright dangerous to the safety of the employees. This lead me to believe that the company was in rough shape. If you’re willing to risk a lawsuit for a clearly dangerous workplace that multiple people have pointed out to you then the company must not have any other choice. Anyway… I was running a job site and my client was the US government. As the end of the job neared part of my role was to notate on paper anything that wasn’t needed or was on back order or was damaged etc. there was a ton of unnecessary product that had been ordered for this job. So I wrote it up and highlighted each line item that wasn’t used. When I got back to the office my supervisor asked to see the paperwork, declared that I could not and should not write up any of the issues with excess product being ordered. I explained to him that I was fairly certain that what he was asking me to do was to participate in a felony (defrauding the government) and that I would not be able to do what he asked. The next day I was called into his office and terminated with severance pay. That was February 13th 2020. They tried to dispute my unemployment filing but failed. I started getting unemployment payments of $550 a week….. then Covid. Unemployment went up to $1150/ week!!! I sat my fat lazy ass on my couch and pulled in 2-3 times what my now former coworkers were making working. Business slowed for the company to a near halt and guys started to get second jobs. I watched Maury and got day drunk. It’s around this time that someone (totally not me) posted a review of the company on indeed [the reviews](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Advanced-Office-Environments/reviews). As the extra $600 in Covid unemployment ran out I started a new job with a growing company with a promotion and an increase in pay of about 20%. Fast forward to February or March of 2021 and I get a call from my old boss. He wants to know how the new job is, what’s going on in my life, “how’s mom”. We were never pals so my red flags are way up, to the point where I just hang up. He calls back 4 times right away. I finally pick up and very abruptly say “make it quick and get to your point I’m busy.” He proceeds to tell me about this online review that he found posted on indeed that he thinks I posted that he disagrees with. I’m dying. He goes so far as to specifically call out that the poster claims that the company is in rapid decline and that that is completely false. He asks that if I were the person to post it could I please take it down so that…….. THEY DONT HAVE TO TAKE FURTHER LEGAL ACTION!!! I laughed into my phone and hung up. For those who are unaware, making that threat… if I were the poster… opens the door to a protective lawsuit called a SNAPP suit. Anywho… if you made it this far you deserve the payoff. 2 weeks ago the company informed all employees and clients that as of 12/31/21 the business would be closing down!!!!!!!

I (24F) am autistic and have ADHD, but I’m okay with working a full-time corporate job for the most part because it creates enough structure for me to plan my day around. I live in the U.S. Of course I wish I could work part-time and earn enough to make a living, but I live in a very expensive area and capitalism is a thing.

I started my previous job after college. It had enough sophistication to keep me on my toes and my coworkers were friendly, supportive people, so I had a good experience. The problem was, I stayed there long enough that I was promoted to the role of a trainer for new hires earlier this year, and the stress of hyping myself up to teach people and answer their questions and help them out all day long was burning me out. I'm a writer, and while I used to be able to devote my evenings and weekends to do what I love, after my promotion all I could do was veg out after work while my executive dysfunction took its toll.

I started a new job recently, which is a contract role with a decent chance of becoming a full-time one in a year. The pay is 10k higher than what I made at my last job, and it is fully remote. I am enjoying it so far because the job is a lateral move in the same industry, so a lot of my past knowledge is applicable. I'm just working at a different department, but still doing entry-level tasks.

My uncle, a career-driven man who has been climbing his way up the corporate ladder since the 90s, has been nagging me (ever since I first started my last job right out of college!) to network for the purpose of finding a new job. He knew how much I made at my last job because he was the one who put in a resume for me, and he helped me out during the interview and hiring process, which I am very grateful for. I was definitely underpaid at that job, but I made enough to live in a shared apartment with roommates with enough left over to buy what I want (and save a little), so I was happy enough for the time being. But my uncle has been making a six-figure salary for like twenty years so his standards are different. (I hope he's not on reddit, though he’s also not, well, anti-work enough to be here!)

Networking is a literal nightmare for me. While I can force myself to socialize with people if I need to, it's not something that comes naturally to me, and frankly, I just don't care enough about non-writing work to put in so much effort. I mean, I did some networking through LinkedIn to find my current job, but I wouldn't do it again if I didn't have to. Having higher-level jobs would also mean more responsibilities, and I don't want to take a chance at a sophisticated role and end up with a shitty work-life balance. Ultimately my dream is to write full-time or find ways to sustain myself that don't involve working at an office for 40 hours a week. It will take years to get to that point, but I’m not in a rush. As far as I’m concerned, a simpler corporate job with writing time in my free time is good enough.

I had lunch with my uncle today, and he told me my new job is too simplistic (for lack of a better term) to stay in for too long, and I should start looking for a new role as early as 6 months in. I hate change, and while I would like to make more money, I also know that I am better off with lower pay in exchange for stability (i.e. NOT job-hopping) for the sake of my mental health. I don't care about growth opportunities as much as I do about having money and insurance. It's just frustrating that he wouldn't stop offering unsolicited career advice when he has the privilege of a very high-level position and no disabilities (that I know of).

We’re not close enough that he knows about my autism and ADHD. I have considered coming clean about not wanting career advice from him, but preparing for that conversation is \*almost\* as taxing as the thought of networking, lol. I also only see him once every two months or so, so I’m not too keen on arguing with him, especially as he is someone who operates on the assumption that he is right. Advice and/or encouragement would be appreciated, though I am also happy to simply commiserate with you all, as this is a rant post.

TL;DR: I am doing well mentally with a lower-stress corporate job. I work to live and don't care to exhaust all my energy into job-hopping for more pay, or networking, or advancing my career. My uncle, a career-driven guy, is nagging me to keep job-hopping. I just want to be left the hell alone.",A rant: I don't care enough about work to job-hop for the sake of more money.

The only two arguments you ever see are: 

1. It will increase prices and cost of living and it could lead to spooky inflation.
2. It will lead to automation and job-loss.

WHAT THE FUCK?

Point one is pure bullshit, because the prices would never rise an equal percentage when compared to the workers pay, because there is more than just wages going into the price of each product. It takes 4th grade math to understand a 25% increase to 50% of a product´s cost (being very generous here) would not also raise the price of the product by 25%. Like the wage just rose. Dipshits. The raise could never, *mathematically,* lead to a decrease in spending potential for those working minimum.

And point two is only a fucking threat because they know very well that finding a job to keep living *is fucking hard.* Why else would we care about jobs getting automated? Wouldn´t such a situation, where it´s so hard to find work, require a good program for those who didn´t find work paying enough to live off of?

And yet, somehow, everyone you ever see arguing against a minimum wage increase also argues against other forms of social wellfare, because poverty is a *""moral failing""* to them, where people just don´t grasp one of the seemingly plentyful opportunities...

What they say boils down to nothing but ""*Fuck you, I got mine.""* 

*How else could they argue this, and still oppose other, more direct forms of social welfare?*

It is very much possible to have people work *less* and earn *more*, like it was before; the only real downside these people see and somehow always forget to mention is, that the increase in prices, the ""inflation"", would hurt those already well off and not affected by the raise. Or that a wage increase could cut into profits of the bosses? A tiny little bit?

Why don´t they admit they only don´t want to raise the minimum wage because it would hurt the profit margins of the rich? They can´t, because we don´t care about the wealth of the rich. We *want* the wealth gap to shrink. 

People who oppose an increase in minium wage are either ghouls, or misguided. As long as you promote for an increase in unemployment benefits/UBI alongside the increase of minimum wage, there is *nothing* you would lose.

Small background: I have been a remote worker prior to Covid-19, so obviously I know that it's not possible to attend social work gatherings as they'd take place in-office, which is on the opposite side of the country for me.

Saying that, Covid came along last year and everyone got sent home to work. I received a virtual invite to join a virtual Christmas event. I double-checked with my coordinator if us remote workers can join said event, only to be told no, it is for in-office staff only. 

I asked why this is the case as there's finally an event that is not location-bound. Only to be told that it's to make it up to those who couldn't gather in-person. They had sick prizes for the raffles too and I got quite mad about it since the company had a whole spiel about staying home, isolation and how that impacts mental health. Quite frankly I think that's all a farce. If they truly understood what it's like to be a remote worker for only one year, then how this in any way, shape or form fair. So I complained to my department's head.

Fast-forward to this year, and saw the announcement again for the Christmas party (as far as I know all, if not most employees are still working from home) and same crap - remote workers are to be excluded and my department head forgot to follow it up at the beginning of the year.

Additionally, remote workers where I work do not get offered the same holiday bonuses &amp; extra paid time offered to others in-studio. Like I totally get that it's an incentive for those who would commute to work, however we do exactly what every other employees do in the same role (just no commuting).

The majority of Friday will be customers yelling at us for not having phones available to sell. If you are older than a millennial and think “I don’t do any of that stuff” let me stop you right there. You are most likely unaware that you treat us poorly. Or you are in the small minority, and I shouldn’t have to thank you for treating me like a human, but thank you. Trust me, I’ve been doing this 5.5 years. I have enough experience to know for a fact that a customer older than a millennial has a a good tendency to treat me poorly. Maybe not today, but you statistically will at one point. Not trying to start a generational war, just pointing out facts based on my own personal experience (and the experience of my coworkers). I’m also not saying that no millennials or younger treat me like trash, but I can probably count on one hand the number of times that millennials or younger have been mean/rude to me or yelling at me.

Side-rant, when I started 5 years ago, we had around 18 employees (4 of which were managers) at my location. We now have 9 (2 of which are managers) and are considered fully staffed by upper management. If one employee has a day requested off, no one else can have it off. If an employee calls in sick, we are screwed for the day. On top of that, no is getting paid twice as much for having to do twice the work since losing half of the staff.",Working for cellular service carriers - a rant,2

I work for a hotel in the middle of downtown in a city in NC that's known for its uniqueness and the young, fun people that live here. We have a lot of vagabonds and a big homeless population as well. Like most cool small towns, people are buying up property like crazy and everything here is expensive as fuck. 

Anyway this elderly lady came down to the front desk asking for a manager because of all the homeless in our stairwell. I apologized to her and let her know that the parking garage and stairwell aren't owned by us, but we do patrol it for suspicious activity hourly. She then continued to say there were camps of homeless sleeping in our stairwell and that it was unacceptable that she had to walk through these people and that she feared for her life and that this was a safety issue. I did let her know that non guests aren't able to get into hallways cause you need a room key and that there is an elevator inside the hotel that requires a room key to use as well. Again she went on about the homeless and how it was unacceptable that she needed to ""share her space with these street walkers"" and how she was going to contact the authorities. I apologized to her again and explained that it was 27 degrees last night and the stairwells are heated and its understandable why people would flock to sleep in the stairwell. I tried to ensure her again that anyone who isn't a guest can't get onto the room floors. She cut me off and said ""You know I feel for them I really do my heart goes out to them, but they cannot be in there while I need to use it"". 

Its so frustrating to live in a city where people like this lady come to visit, are able to spend $400-$600 a night on a room, buy up all the property, come here because of the environment and the crowd, and then choose to look down on those who were failed by a system they got lucky with.

Now I've got a great career at a job I love, with enough money to support my family and pay my mortgage. I should be able to retire comfortably in 15–20 years. It all went according to plan.

So why am I anti-work? Because I know how \*insanely\* lucky I am. I know how rare this is. It was rare twenty years ago, and it's even rarer now. Those people with their TED Talk-lite Instagram accounts telling everyone, ""I worked hard, look where it got me, and you can get here too if only you work hard!"" are either delusional or they know they are full of shit.

If you look around at your fellow human beings, at people who work their asses off, at people you went to high school with who are barely scraping by, at people who trudge to a job they hate day in and day out just so their kids can have health insurance, and your thought is, ""If they worked hard and were awesome like me, they wouldn't be in this mess,"" you are a special kind of soulless asshole. You know what separates me and everyone else who the system actually benefits, and those it doesn't (apart from heaping amounts of privilege)? Luck. That's it. Luck. So much of my life is because I was in the right place at the right time, and I knew the right people. It boggles my mind that other people don't think ""Wow, I'm lucky, I should help others,"" and instead think, ""I'm better than these people.""

And look, this isn't some ultra-woke progressive soyboy self-hate. I do have skills that I've taken the time to learn that make me good at my job. I'll gladly take credit for the things I've accomplished. I'm a functioning, reasonably intelligent adult who is capable in a lot of ways. But lots of people are functioning, intelligent, capable adults! Most people show up on time and do their jobs well! For fuck's sake, the idea that I'm somehow more special or worked harder than people really struggling to get by? The only people who believe that are the people who have to tear everyone else down to feel like they're standing on a pedestal. Most people are good at something! Those skills I have? Lots of people can learn them...except they can't because when in the hell are they supposed to find the time to do that? And what good do those skills do them when every single job posting requires 5 years of experience and an advance degree? And what happens when they have those skills but now they aren't in demand anymore, or 200 other people have those skills and are competing for 3 jobs? Why is it so hard to acknowledge the reality that so many people confront every single day? Not everyone can afford college or find the time to go.

Aside: Do you know why companies tout their tuition reimbursement programs? Because they know they're offering a ""benefit"" that most employees can't use. Those employees are too exhausted and too busy raising a family or working another job to hit the books and go to school after their boss micromanaged them for 8 hours. If an employee can actually use and benefit from a tuition reimbursement program, that's swell. Fan-fucking-tastic. But let's be really clear on the underlying implication of tuition reimbursement programs: It's companies saying, we don't have to pay more because employees who aren't lazy will go to college and then get a job where they earn more. But people who can't go to college because they're caring for a disabled parent or watching their kids or suffering from depression or countless other things in life that are none of your or my fucking business also deserve a living wage.

I am no better, no more talented, and no more capable than anyone else. It is astounding to me to look around and see so many people lying through their teeth about meaningless platitudes like ""hard work"" and ""putting in your time."" Actually, it's worse than that, because I don't think most of these people are lying. I think they're suffering from severe delusions. They really do think they work harder. They honest-to-god believe they hit that triple and were not born on third base. They think their comfortable lifestyle was only possible because they somehow are part of the daily grind. And they have convinced themselves that all anyone else needs to do to get ahead is to clock in like 30 minutes early and voila! Problem solved, and if you don't solve it, you're lazy. They are completely, utterly untethered from reality and from what millions of people in the U.S. (and millions more around the world) face every single day. And none of this gets into all the other issues—flat wages for decades, skyrocketing housing costs, our completely dysfunctional healthcare system (in the U.S., at least), loss of pensions, the systematic dismantling of unions—that people who aren't as lucky as I am are confronted with.

I know there's tension sometimes on this sub between true anti-work and labor reform or heavily regulated capitalism or whatever, and I get that. But it all starts with this. It starts with acknowledging how much of the brokenness is supported not solely by the rich, but by selfish middle-class people who, for the sake of their own egos, to somehow believe they got ahead by virtue of their hard work and their own bootstraps. It's appalling.","I did everything right, everything the way they said, and it all worked out perfectly, just like they said—a Gen-X rant",327

Extra millenial vibes. But, it baffles me. I have been working full time since 2017, fresh out of college. Almost five years. Only five years. 

During those five years I have worked in an office, in highschools, from home, with people I enjoyed working with or for and with people I despised. 

And, in the beginning, sometimes it hit me that working didn't make me happy. Some days were nice, others were garbage, but I was mostly exhausted every night and every weekend. 

I stopped partying. I stopped doing art. I stopped enjoying life as a whole, I am just waiting for the weekend so I can sleep and not socialize. Because socializing is imposed during the week, I don't have the energy to do more of it Saturday and Sunday. I'm an introvert and the office small talk bore and exhausts me. 

After five years, the thought that I am not happy, that I don't see myself doing this until I am old enough to retire hits me every two hours instead of once a month. 

The pandemic made it better. Being at home with my partner was a dream for me. I worked still but I was not in an office, not around people imposed on me, I could sleep more, I started doing art again, reading again. 

This week we have to go back to an office. And right now, I am dreaming quitting. But I can't. Because my rent is incredibly expensive. Because I have student debts. Because I have to work to survive. Sometimes I think that I will not make it to 65. 

I dream of the UBI. I dream of having all my needs met and being able to be more involved in my community, volunteering, growing my food during summer, being more present as a big sister, a friend, a daugther, a neighbor. Working because I really want to, because I care about what I do during my productive hours.

I used to work for a guy who owned his own Plumbing Company who did not know how to use a computer and who did not know how to perform simple admin skills.  This particular Business Owner (BO) put more stock into his plumbers rather than his office and the staff.  This BO was so ignorant about the importance of the office he refused to let me rewrite the SOP's to something that those coming in after I quit would know how to do the job.  See below example (EX.-1) of how his SOP's are.  He actually thinks that there is nothing wrong with hiring an office admin and just having that person ""just figure it out, it's just simple office work, how hard can it be?""  

*(EX.-1)  Check mail. If there are any checks enter in the payment then give check to owner to deposit.       \[That was exactly how it was worded, imagine the whole two page SOP being just like this for the entire office.\]*

He also didn't see the need for organization in the office and doing things right from the start.  The girl he hired before I quit did such sloppy work that on the Plumbing proposals he started losing more potential work because of it.  Because he is administratively clueless when she showed him her proposals so he knew it was done he ""didn't see anything wrong with them.""  The thing about this plumber is that the area he works in is of very well-off people most of which are professionals who a few are millionaires.   These perspective people will not use a company who doesn't know the difference between ""for and four.""  

Being a perfectionist I just could not stay with that company anymore because I was so embarrassed to even admit that I worked there.  I can honestly say that since I quit over a year ago, he has had three come and go of whom worked in the office.  It had amazed me that he has made it in the ten years he has been in business.  This brings me to the part of the reason for this post,  he is being sued by a girl who last worked for him because he didn't want to pay her more than $12 per hour.  I told him on my last day that he needed to pay the sole office employee at least $25 per hour since that person is actually working as a Business Manager, plus taking his calls as late as 11 pm without pay.

I hated this job, but it gave me the confidence, skills, and knowledge to start my own Virtual Assistant home-based business.  If it wasn't for this idiot I would not be a business owner only working part-time averaging $1,450 per week - net pay.  

The ironic thing is I recently performed a job for another plumber who was just as bad in some ways but sadly worst in others.  Could it be that I need to stay clear of plumbing companies?

Just know that the skills you learn for any and all jobs can very likely serve you well as a freelancer to eventually becoming your own boss and business owner.  Learn as much as you can from the jobs you hate as that is free training if you decide to become self-employed.

As a long time lurker and first time poster, I just wanted to take some time and rant about my current job situation. Hopefully screaming out into the abyss will lure other kindred folk to be melancholic with me. This is long, extremely obtuse, and totally ignorable. Regardless, I feel at the very least I can find some comfort in the text. 

*I live in upstate NY, so minimum is 12.50 where I'm from. 

Start of Covid, Spring 2020: 

Graduation! I finished up my Bachelor's program in History, with prospects of pushing into my Master's program. This should have been a huge time for celebration, but I quickly found myself cornered in Graduate level class offerings for my program. A lengthy chat with my division head informed me of massive cuts to staff and faculty I'd be working with closely. So, feeling like I shouldn't waste time, I decided to postpone my graduate level in pursuit of full-time employment. This would allow me to build up a cash reserve for the program when it returned to better health and to propose to my then girlfriend. 

Unfortunately, I found myself laid off at my partime contract job at a college due to student enrollment numbers dropping and the switch to virtual education. This really sucked but the financial assistance from the government helped me stay afloat in difficult times until Autumn of 2020, where i was able to pick up hours at the college again until winter.

Covid Cont., Spring 2021:

So, almost about a year from graduation and where do I found myself; healthy cash reserve? No. Stable job in COVID times? Also no. With nothing improving and a possible layoff and or reduction in hours at work again, I apply and recieve a job at a local factory, Saint Gobain. What a terrible environment. 

My time spent at Saint Gobain can be defined as tumultuous. When I interviewed, I was informed and I agreed to a Furnace Operator postion for second shift weekdays (40 hours). Sounded decent enough; the position offered a significant wage increase (from 15.00 to 19.00, later 22.00) for me to set aside a cash reserve, fully move out of my parents, and commit to a life with my now fiancée (I proposed on 12/12/2020, good date right?). What I would soon come to learn is how utter terrible the conditions were. 

I worked from February-September, never missing a day and pushing myself to be a model employee. I worked in all types of conditions (several heavily violated OSHA in hindsight), to make sure I didn't lose my job or affect my relative's recommendation of me to superiors. 

*As an aside, this is a powder factory, so conditions are terrible. Airborne silcion-carbide powder, different chemicals like hydrofloruic acid are common place. 

Anyways, what I was met with was ambivalence for my effort. My physical body was only desired, not my mind nor skills. I helped these people by going above and beyond my job role by writing up safety protocol and procedures for Furnace operation, worked with process engineers to better calibrate mix times for slurry, and acting as interim IT for their expensive computer system that monitors equipment. It was all for nothing! Within the first week, they ignored my agreed upon hours, forcing me to do quick returns and flipping my schedule to days or midnights with a couple hours of notice (average was 50+ hours a week, weirdly coworkers bragged about hitting 65+ hours). In tandem, after spending 3 MONTHS training me on their Furnace, they decide its no longer advantageous and compellty move me to another department (Powder room) where I had to start all over. 

Though, the worst thing by far was when I got hurt. In late July, I got my pinkie finger amputated as my work glove got caught in machinery. Instead of giving me time off, they called me in the next morning after hospital to go over an incident report where they just blamed me for hours. They were more concerned with me being out for the injury then my finger being cleaved!!! Over the next weeks, I just said ""fuck it."" I used up all my vacation time to stay home, rest, and look for employment. I decided that I was tired of being treated like shit and wanted to go back to doing something that has value beyond arms manufacturing with Saint Gobain. So, I decided to take a risk and go back to the college job. 

Covid Cont., Autumn 2021:

I returned to the college with an expanded role to ensure steadier hours, but the pay decrease has been a significant issue. I'm still able to pay bills, but money stress is always terrible, especially around the holidays. Regardless, I've been trying to use my time working at the college to push into something more permanent and higher paying. I've applied for other departments, applied to other colleges, ex. However, nothing except retail and fast food jobs near me are actually willing to pay more than 12.50-16.00 dollars. 

Current reality, present: 

I feel like a failure. I did the ""boomer"" safety plan of enlisting in military service post high school, entering academia and recieving a degree, but now I'm just stuck at trying to stay afloat again. I just don't know anymore. Applying to at least five jobs a day is just formality to me at this point.  Though, it's still extremely discouraging to see jobs in my area that want a Bachelor's Degree and years of teaching experience (which I have!) to simply lead a tour and make 13.50 an hour. 


So, congratulations for reading this far I suppose. Hopefully, there is a takeaway from a complaints in the darkness of the internet. Regardless, for anyone who has read this all, I hope you're doing well. I will continue to struggle on with you.",Late Night Rant,2

Here's where employers can fuck right off. When the first round of lock downs hit, I went back to college to undertake a 1 years honours degree in Software Engineering to update my skills. With great success, I'm now studying for a Masters, to further improve my hirability.

So either college courses aren't cutting and employers couldn't be fucked to say something about it, or they're trying to drive down salaries, by having immigrants work in cities like Dublin, with the belief that €35,000 is an amazing salary. Well it isn't, unless you don't mind sleeping in your car, visiting soup kitchens and having wet wipe showers.

Honestly though, I'm really having a hard time figuring out why I should bother staying here.

Now, to be clear, I disagree with all those things being ok in the USA (I feel all of those need to be addressed). But, from a selfish standpoint, if you are rich this really is probably a great place to live. Your assets are basically stable, strong military prevents instability in the country financially, most the politicians willingly support your causes and the public will even blindly support your causes even when it goes against their interest, etc. etc..

This is something I noticed while speaking to some European tourists.

They (college grad professional jobs) make slightly less money than me, and pay more in income tax in their countries as I do in Florida, but I have to pay everything else out of pocket even after insurance coverage, whereas their's is much cheaper. This is something you realize working in America. Every time I added up my healthcare, self funded retirement, residual self funded higher education costs, Fed State and Local taxes, while ignoring how much I pay in sales tax, I was well over what I would pay living in a social democracy in Northern Europe. With services that pale in comparison.

Should something truly catastrophic happen, your ability to pay for healthcare, housing, food evaporates, and the public options in most of this country with their onerous red tape, are designed to facilitate your death while you wait for them to kick in.

Factor in cheaper rent (even in their capital cities somehow, idk how that works), cheaper transit, twice as much vacation time, etc, and the US advantages fade away real quick. no big difference in grocery costs, and other day to day expenses. much faster internet speeds, affordable &amp; usable phone plans.

The only advantages in America for an employee are cheaper single family homes if you live in such an area, cheaper gas prices (but CA gas prices are about halfway between UK and the rest of US), and cheaper cars (new &amp; used), Your job is in the tech sector, and cheaper guns &amp; ammo.

If you’re not in the tech sector, and are not into cars &amp; guns as a hobby, aren’t born rich, and just want to live as an employee, EU countries give you a much better bang for buck.

Overall though, for the average person, I just don't see the benefits. If one has any illness or health issues (chronic or otherwise), you are basically not guaranteed healthcare and could simply just go bankrupt with no assistance. The culture here is people worrying about petty things (religion and other things) over helping their fellow citizen get proper healthcare, etc..

Please, can someone enlighten me why people regularly claim this country is so great for the average citizen? Ultimately I just don't see it compared to other first world countries and I am strongly considering finding a way out.

But, before I do that, I just wanted to get some thoughts on this. Thanks for any information.","What is the honest benefit of living in the USA over Europe, Canada, Australia, etc.? I really don't see it for the average person. Not a rant, an honest question.",17

I currently work at Target and it’s awful. We’ve have 3 people quit my department just in this month.We are always understaffed and have call outs every single day because they schedule people against their availability and give people unreliable schedules. Like this week I did 3-10:30 every other day and 3:30 to 10:30 and the a random 7am shift in a department I was never trained in. Sometimes they make people work clopens which is closing at 10 then opening at 7am. It’s really hard to have a life when your hours change constantly. It’s hard to make plans or appointments when you don’t know what days you’ll have off. Sometimes I get Tuesday and Thursday off or work 6 to 7 days in a row because our work week starts on Sunday so Tuesday to Monday is considered two different weeks. Then have one day off then your back to it so I really don’t blame people for calling out. The whole day should fall apart if one person calls out for my department.

They “train” everybody to cashier and do ship from store. And by train I mean watch someone for ten minutes on register and then go on your own register. Your constantly pulled away from your area to backup cashiers because they never have enough people and they don’t want more than 2 guests in each line. They literally call people up to ring up 1 person or keep you there for 30min. Your also still expected to finish all your other tasks and sometimes jump in to do ship which can take 30-40min.

Not to say it was so much better years ago but we used to have more teams working like a back room team for example now we’re expected to do everything. We’re called DBOs which is designated business owner which just means we’re responsible for everything in our area like stocking,back stocking,price change, go backs, helping guests, zoning etc. All for the same pay. It’s so stressful all the time.

All the “bonuses” we got this year we’re immediately followed by cutting hours and less people on the floor generally. This last “bonus” we’re getting is honestly a slap in the face. I really don’t get why people are so excited. It’s 17/hr on weekends for the rest of the year because they want employees to stop calling out on weekends. Like we’re not busy every other day of the week.",Target Rant,3

Also for those that don’t know historically the path to be becoming a board certified MD was one filled with incredible abuse and hazing. Things have improved over the past several decades but not much, especially in the time of COVID. Just to give an example what I’m talking about, the hospital I work at gets funding for having a residency program, they get about 150K per resident (roughly). They pay me and my colleges 50K and pocket the other 100K. Then they get to profit on the patient care/ procedures I do while I get nothing. From the hospital’s prospective residency is incredibly lucrative (lots of for profit hospitals are starting or already have residency programs). Now I work roughly 70-80 hours per week, sometimes more. We are encouraged to log our hours ahead of time to avoid any pesky hour violations. I work 30+ hour shifts regularly and subject to mental and verbal abuse daily. During a 30+ hr call shift as an MD I make ~ $5-6/ hr… after these shifts I struggle to stay awake on the drive home, when a mere 30 min early I was expected to care for patients. Now the incident that I would like to rant about took place during my involuntary time manning the covid ICU: 

Covid ICU was a literal nightmare, one of the worst times of my life to say the least. People would come in, I would have to explain to them all the procedures including intubation that they needed. I would be the one to help them facetime with their families for the last time and I would be the last person to ever speak to them before sedating them and putting them on a ventilator. Our hospital was not only running on a skeleton crew but also operating with almost no medical supplies. I was having to make due with limited medications and limited supplies for procedures. I remember walking out of a patients room who had just coded when I spot 2 people dressed in suites with crisp pristine white coats on. They stood their just staring at me. I walked over and introduced myself and asked if I could help them. Again they just stared almost in disbelief, then they introduced themselves as board members of the parent company that owned the hospital. The older gentleman in front looked at me and said, “ what were you doing in there?” I said something along the lines of we were coding someone. I remember him just blankly staring and saying, “ well you are doing good work, let us know if there is anything you need.” A nurse behind me instantly started naming medications and supplies that we had run completely out of or needed from the main supply room. These two administrators instantly became pissed off, straightened their white coats and left without saying a word and without letting the nurse even finish her sentence. In that moment my disdain for administration was never higher. Some asshole who probably made 7 figures during a pandemic had never taken care of a patient a day in his life. Meanwhile residents are making $100/day for 14-15/hr shifts, nurses, techs, respiratory therapy is working like dogs and getting shit for pay too. Everyone I know is trying to get out of medicine.",Anti-Work Rant: Hospital Admins,25

Played Cello for 7yrs so i thought why not get a job playing into that. Hourly pay was $9/he HOWEVER we got commission after hitting an individual monthly sales goal(mine of course was lower because I was PT). The goals were fair; basically I'd have to sell about 2 instruments a month to meet it and then the rest of my sales, I'd get commission on (i think my biggest commission check was $1700). They did mention that they recently switched over to a new all inclusive company wide system that handles everything (billing, inventory, shipments) so there's been a few hiccups, but they assured me it been smoothed out

So i took the job and learned a lot about band instruments, renting out instruments for school, re stringing a marimba, etc...even sold a violin my second week😁. And then the District Manager asked me to move to the Pro Shop across town (about a 20min drive). They wouldn't pay me extra because ""at the pro shop, youll be selling an instrument every other day"" plus they wanted/needed a string player there. So i agreed.

I get to the pro shop, with its own in-house repairman and the place was admittedly nice. It definitely had a much larger and more upscale selection of instruments (the most expensive being $10k). People there were indeed hitting their sales goals and everything was good for awhile. 

About 3 months in, after school starts, shit hits the fan all at once. Customers start coming in complaining about getting billed incorrectly for their kids instruments (ex a violin is like $25/mo, and they got billed $80. One only got billed for tax es for 6 months then the system billed her for the actual rent all at once). Of course the new system only let us read the basic information on the account, so we could only apologize and send off emails to billing. Soon that gets settled.

The next month we had our big sales event where everything went well (these was always advertised to employees as the ""guaranteed commission"" events) and i made about $600 in commission off of it. Even made some networking connections with the most prestigious instrument manufacturers. After that, things were normal until around the end of the school year.

Once again, the all inclusive system was having issues, but worse. Now it was just fucking up accts left and right. One acct was sold off to a Collections Agency after 1 missed payment. Another got billed for a while year all at once. One person made a single purchase in store, and somehow got that turned into a recurring transaction. Whatever billing nightmare you can think of, it happened. So customers were marching in(rightfully so) left and right. We were in hell. 

It was fairly obvious that the system was just fucked, however, our manager, a relic from the 80s, said we were not ALLOWED to complain amongst ourselves about it. ""It's not the system. There's no way this would happen unless someone went in and hit a button. Remember to hit your sales goals =)"" Eventually the company made a dedicated dept to handle billing issues. It was 3 people to handle the entire country. As in 3 people handling the billing issues of about 70 different stores, and God knows how many fucked accounts. And the only way to contact them was by email. It would take about 3weeks to fix an account, if the customer was lucky. I swear to God, it was no longer a music store, we were just a complaint center for billing. We were so busy sending off emails and closing people's rental accounts (the only way to force stop billing), cancelling in-house lessons, sales tanked. HARD.

Eventually, things cooled down, but morale took and enormous hit. We (employees) were SCARED to pick up the phone because customers got so vicious. Some called every day, some every hour and it was the same song and dance. We got our hourly pay of course, but sales were down and as a result, sales goals were up (to make up for it of course). I dreaded coming into work. I had nightmares about it. We still had each other (co workers truly keep you sane) but it was just bad. But our manager would always say the same thing ""oh this will pass. You guys are dwelling too much. Let's focus on sales goals and getting people to sign up for lessons""

The next big instrument sale was upon us. We were required to call up every lead and band/orchestra instructor recommended student, practically beg them to come in and set an appointment, notate it, and show our manager. If we didn't book at least 5 a shift, he would eavesdrop on us and then take over the call if he felt it wasn't going well. We then had to do weekly follow ups to make sure they don't forget. I wanna say the goal was 20 appointments for me.

 Somehow, we got our appointments and the event was set. All of the best instruments from every pro shop in and out of state were present. Representatives from every manufacturer and all store managers, including the DM were all ready dressed in suits(dress code)

The entire night was depressing. Everyone in suits and dresses sitting around on their phones forced to make small talk to avoid the elephant in the room. And of course, my manager would go around  telling everyone to out their phones away because ""it's about to pick up""

7 instruments sold. Total. Most appointments didn't show up

After somberly getting everything packed up, the DM and my manager came out from a lesson and said ""we are very disappointed in your collective lack of effort. You all were instructed to call your appointments to remind them to come. Your first and only objectives for the next few weeks is to get them in the store to buy an instrument. We're expecting at least 5 from each of you.""

That was the beginning of when True Hell and Mental Abuse began.

The hours are long, the work is neverending, and some patients take a little bit of your soul when they succumb to their personal demons or pass away. With COVID, a lot of frontline workers have seen more death than they ever expected. In America, it's particularly shit because of the lack of structured medical care and private insurance tied to employment status.

It is heartbreaking to see people turned away because they cannot afford to self-pay for an appointment or get lab tests done. And as someone who sets prices for services when sending claims to insurance companies and then fights with said insurance companies, the prices seem all but arbitrary. So when I see patients get billed full price at some clinics or they try to bill me full price for a low complexity visit and I only spoke to the doctor for 5 minutes? My blood boils. But we have to cover costs to operate and our healthcare is a tragedy. The sheer number of homeless people we step over or walk past that have clear physical or mental health issues *just on a daily basis*, kills a little part of me every day. Knowing what we can do and knowing what we won't do due to greed and inequality, is so much more painful. If you are self-aware and aware of the world around you, compassionate, empathic--just a plain human being with some fucking sense of *humanity*\--then how can you not be pro-people, pro-healthcare, pro-childcare, pro-fuck these people destroying our planet and causing diseases to their workers?

That being said, if you work in the medical field and refuse to get vaccinated, you disqualify yourself from working in the medical field. You are literally going against the tenants of healthcare--do no harm--and also against medical knowledge. It is like working for the government and taking part in a coup or insurrection to take over the government; it disqualifies you from making good-faith decisions in the best interest of the people you are supposed to help and the lives you are taking some responsibility for.

Theoretically, people who are vaccinated can still spread the disease. It can still be spread until a majority of a community or country, etc. get vaccinated. The window is smaller once you are vaccinated because your body fights back the virus quicker and more efficiently, so the virus only has a small amount of time to reproduce within you or, hopefully, no time at all. That’s why it’s important we all get vaccinated, for those who can’t and so that these small windows don’t overlap to a point that transmission is still occurring over a group or community. It is a social responsibility and a part of the social contract of being in our society and a benefactor of it.

That is why I love this sub and also a great deal of pain is felt currently in this corporate oligarchy (in America at least). We are all doing our side of our societal contract by paying our taxes and instead of it helping us, building infrastructure, or god forbid giving glasses to an elderly person--it goes into the pockets of leeches like Elon Musk, other corporate subsidies, and politicians who would gleefully step over your dead body for a five-dollar bill. I would rather pay no taxes than watch politicians literally get paid 100's of dollars to sleep during sessions, *all the while approving their own raises and giving themselves healthcare*.

Is this anti-work? I am anti-work; I am pro-help people. I am pro-we shouldn't collectively be this miserable and have such hatred for a place we spend 40 hours of our week in. If you work 40 hours a week, that is 24% of your week. I hate waking up and internally screaming, even when I love my job and think at least I have a ""good white-collar job"" that helps people in any capacity. I hate waiting for my days to end and arriving home exhausted. I hate sitting in my car in the morning and thinking, ""at least this isn't manual labor""; ""at least I don't have children hitting me in the face every day""; ""at least I don't have to watch people kill themselves every day""; ""at least I do not have to XYZ"". I feel like I need to be grateful for the progress I have made, as though I have had a lot of luck somehow and have ended up where I am at today. I feel like I need to be grateful to have a job that isn't overtly abusive. But why?

I've worked in multiple financial institutions, and am running into the same issues. Most of my career is document review/retention. I'm from the US btw.

Training is a joke - you're basically told to jump in, look at your procedures, and ask questions. Except, you don't know what is required for different files/customers, procedures are old and outdated, and coworkers literally don't have time to always help you. They're trapped in other projects or trying to run the group.

Managers don't understand what your department does every day - they'd rather focus on their excel spreadsheets and make sure the ""numbers look good"" instead of listening to employee concerns. And asking them questions on job roles is useless - they just run to the group veterans for answers. But when it comes to performance, they have plenty to say, despite not knowing what you do every day.

Work Culture - oh my gosh, coming in early and leaving late off the clock to get your work done shouldn't be a thing. Businesses need to understand the underlying reasons why work can't get done within a timeframe. Coming in sick shouldn't be allowed either. We don't have enough PTO to afford getting sick and having viruses linger around the office.

Handling complaints - it's ingrained in you to suck it up and brush off what you're feeling. If you have a disagreement or opinion, companies don't want to hear it. They SAY they want to, but have a different attitude if you speak up. Issues with procedures? Write down every discrepancy and maybe they'll get updated. Problems with training? We don't have time to train you, just keep doing what you're doing. or maybe you'd be a better fit in a different department. Managers don't know the ins and outs of the department? It's because they are so busy, but will eventually get there. Even if they've already been around for years, there's still a lot for them to learn.

What really sucks about my experience is I've jumped between 4-5 places. I spent the most time in one place - about 8 years. I went through at least 10 positions there. EVERY PLACE HAD SIMILAR ISSUES. I'd say maybe 1 job  was fine, and it was the one I went into after graduating from college. It was once I climbed the ladder that everyone (employees and managers) started to seem more miserable.

I got burnt out multiple times throughout my career. I'm feeling the same burn out again. Except this time I feel extra pathetic because I've only been at my current workplace for 4 months. 4 months, and I already want to quit. I guess if anything, my past experiences are letting me see the issues of my current job quickly and easily. I'm so tired of feeling sad and hopeless when it comes to work. I want a stress free job, and be able to make enough money to help support me and my family. It just feels like that will never be a possibility.",I'm tired of being burnt out - RANT,10

My boss gives a 2 minutes forgiveness if employees clock in late. Sometimes he decides to try to leave for lunch or close the business down for the day a minute or two early. He has decided to add the few minutes employees may leave early (which is most of the time decided by himself,and he has given the idea to everyone through practice, that that is ok to do) to the minutes an employee comes in late for the 2 minute maximum allowance. He changed his own policy and didn’t tell anyone but his son. 

His son works at the business too, and last week my boss had his son tally hours from our time cards and instructed him to dock anyone 15 minutes who had went over 2 minutes with leaving early or coming in late combined on every occurrence. Again he never mentioned this to anyone. There have been times I’ve been sitting at my desk at 4:57 and he will have his keys in hand looking impatiently telling me it’s time to go. I have a total of 30 minutes docked from my paycheck for a total of 4 minutes lost. 

His son mentioned to him that some employees are coming in to work 10 minutes early and leaving 5 minutes late for lunch on odd occasion and asked then should we pay them 15 minutes more for that. He said “no, we’re not doing that.” Tf?!!!

This infuriated me. He didn’t tell anyone but his son and I only know bc I work in the same area as his son. The results have already reflected on my paycheck. He is beginning to expect us to work far outside of our job duties. I will be closing down the shop and handling every customer and administrative issue entirely by myself at the end of the day bc several ppl are out. Everybody stuck by him through the pandemic.

post,qvxxeo,2y77d,antiwork,false,2021-11-17T12:10:18Z,https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qvxxeo/its_time_to_hold_recruiters_to_the_same_standard/,self.antiwork,,"TL;DR - For recruiters you are the product and the corporation is the client. If a recruiter sends you a generic email asking if you are interested in a certain job, and the qualifications do not match / are too high for you and you reply just to get ghosted, they deserve to be punished for wasting your time. It's their job to make sure you are a good candidate, not yours.

For context:

* I use LinkedIn
* I have myself set for looking casually.
* I'm still at entry level, mid level at best due to only being hired within the industry for 6mo; which was 2 years ago.
* I got my degree 3 years ago.

I have qualifications within game industry and due to the nature of me gravitating towards being an all rounder, I have A LOT of different skills. Which usualy means that I come up on a lot of different types of searches. From time to time I get contacted by recruiters about some job that is available and I will read their wall of text and it *usually* boils down to one those:

* The message will be long but extremely vague (also really toxic positive about the company).
* The message will be short but at least it mentions what they are looking (and it's still vague).
* The message will contain the full spec of the job, either written or attached as .pdf.
* The message will be one of the above and also completely irrelevant or be for a lead/senior position.
* The message will be one of the above, and it will be attached to connect request (more on that later)

I usually reply that I'm interested in hearing more if spec was not given and it usually results in the following scenarios:

* I will get just straight up get ghosted.
* I will get a notification the the person has looked at my profile, and thats it.
* I will get a reply stating that I do not have enough experience or my skills are irrelevant (THEN WHY DID YOU SEND IT TO ME ???!!!).
* I will actually get a requrest to send my CV and CL (this has not happened in 2 years now)

It usually takes me 10m to format my message to sound proffesional and all that pointless corpo dogshit ass garbonzo and toxic positivity bullshit. If CV and CL is required that can take 30m for CV and up to 1hr for CL trying to cater it to the spec. Mind you, I ain't getting paid shit to do this either, while the recruiter does.

The job of a recruiter is to gather good candidates for the role and they are being paid for it. But a vast majority of them from my experience just use the minimun amount of effort to reach the highest amount of people and then filter them out as they actually reply. Which means they put some generic keywords, click search, and message all who show up with 1 button, as like to call it shotgun spamming everyone involved. And then only picking creme of the crop. Sure it is smart for them to do this, however surely they must understand that there is a human on the side of their shotgun blast, right?

Following this thought process I came to realization that I'm a product. And the corporation hiring the recruiter is the client. On top of that, those which gave you a connection request at the same time, now benefit from their public posts showing for your connection's (the people that you added as ""friends"" for those who dont use LinkedIn) feed; aka they gain access to higher range of ""products"". I do not know why it took me 3 years to figure this out, but if it took me this long, then there is a chance that a lot of you also didn't think about this, which is why I'm writing this post.

I'm so tired of wasting my time for FREE while they are twiddling their thumbs and using technology to waste MY time WHILE being PAID for doing it. Oh also screw your CV/CL filtering algos. If they aren't willing to treat me as human but rather a product, then they will get the same treatment from me. Today I went through my message history and found all of the recruiters which ghosted me, and promptly blocked them, including the ones that I'm connected with. If they are treating me as a product, then I will treat them as a service, and frankly, they are a very shit service.

From this point on, if I get ghosted I will message them a week later and ask why I was ghosted, if I don't like their response (or it sounds like bullshit) I will block them.

I worked in the US, in a retail store that I won't name. Could be any of them. I worked my way up from temp to Receiving manager. I was very good at my job and bought into the whole ""if we don't make sales, we have to cut payroll"" So, this went on, me being naive and young. Then I would get written up for the freight not moving fast enough. The corporate and self audits always found me lacking. I played the game, I did what they told me... I hauled an inhuman amount of freight often alone. I was so good at inventory they put our store on a special program, for which there were ""extra"" hours allocated for me to check manifests in detail. One of those boxes could contain hundreds of boxes within, tiny highly specialized items. Think buttons. 

I'd take in trucks with a sparse team. Christmas time was the worse. Cold, open bay hands cracked, thousands of tiny little products to be sorted so fast. Sometimes two trucks back to back. Our deliveries taken in and sorted, my manager would then send people to the cash register or other department more often than not. Leaving HUGE piles of freight. She said we just didn't make sales that week and had to cut from somewhere. 

If I was sick, they wouldn't even try. If I had a vacation, the manager would magically allocate hours for freight and clean out my backroom. Upon my return she'd say, ""See! Why couldn't you do this?!"" She did not like it when she said they worked so hard(!) and I said in front of them ""I work this hard every single day!!""

I found out this store, out of all the ones in the United States was number one out of maybe... 250(?) stores nationwide for selling payroll. #1 #1 #1 Great. What that means is the payroll was so gutted that we showed we could make the store more profitable with less people doing the work. There were 2 salaried positions when I left, but neither of those people could really sling freight. 

I made it five years at the place. The wiser I got and the more the store manager hated me. She knew I knew, but every little mistep I took was her opportunity to get me out. Again, some bullshit audit came up, and of course I had too much old product, not prioritized sitting in the back, yadda yadda.... I already had a notice in my pocket. If I knew then what I would have know now, I'd have let her fire me. She prided herself on never letting anyone claim unemployment. Shrewd terrible woman. I hope your bonuses were worth it you bitch. You profited off of my back and eagerness. You lied through your teeth and I believed. Never again.

I started off as a warehouse associate making 10 an hour. As soon as Covid hit, our warehouse supervisor was fired. Me and the other associate took over all duties. It took me a full year of running things (mostly by myself because my coworker was very tech illiterate) to get from 13 an hour to 18 an hour. That was only because I forcibly asked for large raises or I would leave. 

Every day was back breaking work. Lifting thousands of pounds of boxed wire, metal pipe, etc. I blew my back out multiple times. Reaggravated  lingering knee and neck issues. Most of the time I had to suffer through because we were only given 5 paid vacation days and no PTO/ sick time. After many members of staff leaving most of us were consistently overworked. And management couldn’t care. Temps were brought in then hired in. These people had no clue what they were doing and I was forced to train every single one. 

At the end of it all I was having extreme mental health issues because of this job. I was started to lash out at work because I couldn’t handle the stress of everything. On a particular day when my co supervisor left 4 hours early we had a large order come through and get cancelled 3 separate times forcing us to pull and put away large and heavy items several times. I lost my cool in the warehouse away from people but someone must have heard me. I was fired over the phone. Not even face to face after literally putting my blood, sweat, and tears into the company. Since more people have left and even some have walked out because of how bad it’s become. 

Well I’ve decided it’s time to shame them. If you live in Akron, Ohio, do not shop with Apex Electrical Supply. The owners are greedy. They will take uncollected orders and bill the accounts hoping the customer won’t notice and either take the product for themselves or sell it to another customer. They are racists who treat black customers and workers with much less respect than their white counterparts. The GM (who is the owners son) will take company money to buy his wife a new car and to support his cocaine habit. They exploit their workers with no care for mental health. 

These businesses are the exact thing wrong with America. Boycott them if you can. Boycott any company that does not treat their employees as humans. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading

So I’m a 22 year old from Ireland and I’m really starting to see that society these days (especially since COVID) is causing a massive labour shortage in the economy. 

And I totally get it, why would I work just to get shit thrown at me day in day out?. Just earning enough to live, I’m definitely not against capitalism, most of us wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for that. 

Instead of everyone expressing themselves in unique ways, doing something you actually are passionate about, IT CAN BE ANYTHING because everyone has that one thing to offer to the world, be it helping people, designing and making furniture you love, ANYTHING.

I’m recovering from Chronic Mental Health issues and I’m getting better every day, Ive found my passion in doing extreme things (downhill mountain-biking, skydiving, surfing, travel etc.) meeting new people, and I hope to volunteer soon at a mental health care facility helping people who need it, just like I did. 

I work remote online and it’s more than enough to sustain this lifestyle and to be honest, I think I will actually be better off in the long run.

I started at this company a few years ago doing order fulfillment/data entry, and you could tell right off the bat that the company had a high turnover rate. Regardless of that I thought the work was easy and the pay was good plus the higher ups bought pizza every month to celebrate a job well done. 

So a little before the pandemic hit the manager of fulfillment asked me and another associate to handle customer/client relations which I had no problem with it was even easier work than before but very high in volume. To put this in context we reach out to vendors on all of our orders and ask for updates and then relay to the customer, think about around 700-1000 orders to check on a day. This is where the the first problem comes into play. My manager wanted me and the other associate to help out with order entry because we were still part of the team and we had to meet our quota for the day. Ok cool no big deal until it gives the rest of the team the impression that our work isn’t important and can wait. This caused a few arguments in the office that once taken to hr resulted in nothing because ‘it’s a high stress situation and people sometimes say what they don’t mean when stressed.’ Sure I guess.

Second issue came when the pandemic finally came. Everyone in the office began to work from home except, you guessed it, me and my associate. Mind you at this time I had discovered I was pregnant and already disclosed it to management so I was considered to be at high risk to contract the illness. And the reason why we had to stay in the office until the last minute? To covert our paper info to digital. So not only are we days behind work that they expect us to make up but we’re in the office, exposed doing something that IT or management should be doing. I’m pissed but at this point I just want to get finished so I can wfh and be comfortable.

Everything was fine up until 2 months before I give birth. I start asking if someone was going to take over my work while I was on leave and if so who was it so I can email them a file explaining what to do and how to do it. My manager doesn’t know and the don’t try to find someone until 3 weeks before I go out! And they asked by sending out an email to the team asking if anyone wanted to cover for me. What!?! Unfortunately the baby decided to come a little early, before I could get everything in order. 

Life goes on I check in occasionally and then the week before I’m scheduled to come back I get asked if I’m able to return to work early. Okay sure not a big deal. That is until I am told that I won’t be returning to my old position instead I’ll be continuing to fulfill orders with the rest of the team. Uh what? I asked the manager why this decision was made and if there were any mistakes made in my end that I wasn’t aware of. She couldn’t give a clear answer and while I was angry and upset I move on to training? Which they apparently thought I needed because ‘I’ve been out of the game for so long’. 

Whatever everything was cool until a few months later when I had my yearly review and they asked me why I didn’t finish some of work. Umm excuse me? Sorry I didn’t plan to have my baby early! And then they gave me the smallest raise out of the whole team for two years of work. I’m raging because not only did they make it out like it was intentional but I’m starting to feel like I’m being punished for being pregnant.

Push comes to shove when my husband has to have major surgery and needs to be on bed rest and have me drive him to his afternoon appointments. I ask my manager to get part time until further notice since I was unable to take leave again. She say she’ll let me know how ever the Friday before I’m supposed to start my new schedule I haven’t heard back. So I email my manager and cc hr and then hr responds that there are no part time positions. I asked if they were letting me go as I couldn’t work full time any longer to which they asked me if I truly exhausted all of my options. I said that I had and they told me that I needed to make a decision then. I quit a little after that.

I (23) moved from Ireland to Sweden to both start an internship and live with my Swedish partner. The company I work in has 3 members of staff, and none of them have any experience or knowledge in my MSc degree and internship title (Regulatory Affairs). The internship is 5 months long in total and ends at the end of December.

Over the last few weeks I have been telling my boss (who is also the company's CEO) that my graduation is this date in early December and I really want and intend to go, since my BSc graduation last year was cancelled. Her only acknowledgement of this was an unhappy face and  ""I never went to my graduation"". Yesterday we had a call about how I would plan my last month of work, since I had flights booked to go to my grad and I wanted to ensure that I would have all of my work complete before I went. I told her that I was certain everything would be done (since they barely give me anything to do anyway).

Let me tell you, she was not happy when I said I would be missing 6 work days (due to low availability of flights and actually wanting to see my family at Christmas). She asked if I would be working remotely and I said I *could* catch up at night if needed but no, I hadn't planned on it because I wanted to be with my family. 

She started saying that due to Christmas I would basically only be in for 2 weeks in December (completely untrue, the company is closed on the 24th and 31st which are the only other days I wont be in) and that we never discussed vacation or how the company would be compensated for my missed time. She also claimed that I didn't give enough notice (I told her about my grad two weeks ago, making it almost 6 weeks of notice). 

I find all of this funny for a few reasons. Her failing to cover vacation or time off in my contract is not my problem. Secondly, I'm an *intern* who gets paid a monthly stipend of 1000€ (I was recently told at a job interview that an entry level role with my degree gets me close to €3000 a month) so like, what compensation is she expecting? She knows I travel 2.5 hours a day by bus to come to work when all of my work can be done remotely. I haven't taken any other days off work (a few half days to get vaccines and visit the doctor). When my 19 year old dog died I was absolutely distraught and said I wouldn't come to work the next day. Her response? ""Will you be working from home?"". No ""sorry for your loss"" or anything showing any sort of empathy. I told her I would work from home that day, I didn't.

Honestly I just feel like her response to me *attending my only graduation* has been the cherry on the top of a shit cake.",A rant about my internship.,4

There was less than 10 employees and it was ran by a very narcissistic guy and his control freak wife. The oldest son of the wife was also ""working"" a lot there, watching youtube video and stuff.

Anyways, they were over burning and psychologically damaging their employees on purpose. I was young and ignored too much red flags. I wish I would have quit that place sooner. 

Here are few of the shit they did to me and others. 


1- Their fabulous strategy to deter employees from searching a better job during the long unpaid holidays break: 

The guy and his wife received me in their office to tell me how much proud they were of my job and bla bla bla, that they were going to give me a raise at the return of the holiday break. Cool, thanks. 

Fast forward to that date, I asked him about the promised raise and guess what? He acted like he never said such thing and didn’t had enough to offer me a raise. He then asked me when he told me that? I replied, just before the time off, here in your office, even your wife was present. He left me in his office for a few minutes then came back with his wife, who also acted like that scene never happened. What a surprise… I told them; sorry but I was not coming here to deal anything but just wanted to officialize what you two already promised me.

He then started to say, oh very sorry for the misunderstanding, we don’t really have enough to give you a raise, but to avoid any friction I’ll give you a 1$ raise anyways… 

So basically I had to fight to get something he kindly offered me few weeks ago. After that I was 2 years straight without any raise and it was only when I started to call in sick repeatedly (because I was finally searching an other job) that he felt something was off and called me out of the blue to offer me a wild 2$/h raise. Wow, after 2 years, really? lol too late. 


2- Repeatedly downing ideas of others only to steal them later…

They never missed an occasion to laugh at any idea you’ll bring to them and to reminds you how much you are stupid and don’t get the big picture of their so complicated products. They would then wait a few weeks and present your former bad ideas as theirs fantastic one! Wow, how did they think about that!? Genius!

He did that trick to me a lot of time. But to others too. He even fired a guy once, for presumably being incompetent. But few months after they implemented the ""stupid"" system he built. His idea actually saved them a whole lot of money. The hypocrisy was so raw. 


3- Constantly making employee feel small

He would always mismatched names of his female employees, even after working with them for several years. We were 10, not 100. But he would never forget the name of his male employees and male clients though. 


4- Draining good employees to the max 

I was initially supposed to be a graphic designer. But a year in and without having any less task related to design, I also started to have more responsibilities. I became a : redactor, translator, social media manager, blog writer, customer service agent, etc. It was insane, I couldn’t take my full lunch break or the pile of crap I had to deal with would have reached the damn ceiling. 

People in other department could take a week off here and there to travel and have some rest. But me and an other one, we were those ""essential"" employees that couldn’t even take a Friday and Monday off to go to a music show, even if asked many months prior. The answer was, we’ll see, we really need you you know? And they would wait to the last minute, like Thursday 17h, well I thought about it and you can take the 2 days off you asked. Well, too late hein, the show is sold out, hostel too. fuck you!


5- Sever lack of empathy

The funny part is when I had to take 4 months off due to a solid burn out, they needed 5 persons at first to keep up with all my tasks and after a while when they started to finally understand what I was doing, they were only able to reduce that number to 3. 3 fuckin persons to do my damn work. No wonder why I got burned out. During my time off, that lovely boss called me, seemingly to ask me how I was doing, but he couldn’t retain himself to ask a very insensitive question: just to be sure, you aren’t searching for an other job aren’t you?

Yeah, right, middle of a burn out is really the good timing to promote your completely drained empty self to a company. 

An other related topic… The wifey took a lot of pleasure talking about couponing, not for the frugal aspect, but just for fun. Because you know, she has a lot of time off. She also proudly said multiple times how much she likes to bring his younger son to the thrift store so he could give away his old stuff and be more aware of the reality of the poor. I mean it looks great on paper, but when all the employees to which you are telling that speech are actually buying their stuff in thrift shop themselves because you barely pay them, it lose a bit of it charms. 

They also had a huge problem of dryness in their office. They built an extension, but didn’t really updated the heating/cooling system, so there wasn’t any sensor in the new part. As a result, the heating was constantly fighting the AC and it dries the fuck of of the air. A coworker brought a hygrometer and we found out humidity was at 12%. While a healthy range is more like 50%. They also didn’t bother to clean, you could easily draw in dust over all furniture. Walking to heavily on the carpet was creating a dust show. I had debillating sinus pain and a coworker had trouble with her eyes because of that. For two year they didn’t bother to fix anything, I had to bring a medical paper from a doctor to force them to fix the dryness and to clean the damn place. After the exam the doctor thought I was working in a factory, the look on her face when I told her I was working in an office was very memorable. 


6- The superiority show

The guy used to bring his golf club to the dinning room to make a narcissistic speech during our lunch. He would hold it upside down as if it was some sort of fancy cane. Then he would ramble about his accomplishment and goal. I remember that one time when he said that he was going to buy himself a Porsche,  that he was finally arrived at this point in his life and bla bla bla.

I worked at a pet retail store for 9 years. Loved most my coworkers and parts of my job. But the ""available store hours vs store budget"" was bs. I remember one morning I was opening manager (I was dual inventory manager and ship from store manager) and I had 1 other opener with me. That was normal, usually another regular employee would come on between 9-11 and the next manager at 1. We had been short on hours for awhile, because we didn't make enough or some shit. 

  Anyways, that day it was me and J until 2! Well, the dog trainer was in at 9 but she didn't count because she had full classes all day. I was panicking because that morning I had to answer emails, check and run payroll, count and set up the registers, be on a conference call, start my bluedots (a weekly inventory of the entire store, making sure counts were all correct, by myself, and had to do the ship from store (sfs) and be cashier once the store opened in AN HOUR. Well the 2 of the 3 registers decided to update/break down so I had to try to call IT which is a nightmare on any day. I had customers pounding on the door by 830 (we open at 9 assholes!!!) And calling the store nonstop while J is trying to answer the calls and open animals. I skipped the conference call, was picking all orders within sight of the register and trying to blue dot at the same time while helping the random flood of customers as soon as I opened the doors. It was horrible, both me and J near tears doing our best.
 
 The district manager called me about 10 mins after we opened to ask why I wasn't on the conference call. I told him I was busy. He said we had to discuss what was on the call, which was why our store wasn't doing very well in customer service and sales. Keep in mind I have a line of customers at the register, J is helping about 5 others in the back half of the store, the phone lines are ringing, and my sfs device is going nuts and has already dropped about 100 orders for me to pick and pack before 3pm. I told him we needed more hours to schedule more employees at a time. He said that's what all the 'bad' stores claimed and it wasn't a good enough excuse.

  I snapped. Told him that without enough hours of course were going to fail, and that I did not have anytime to explain it to him due to the fact I was currently MOD, sfs, blue dotting, cashier, customer service, phone answering, etc etc and I only had 1 other person that was floor, animals, customer service, had to do the fish order and my backup until 2 o'clock and we were already busy as fuck! He said he'd call me back later at another time. Never did, but given my long time there I had made several friends that knew how much I did and had my back so I wasn't that worried about possibly losing my job.

  On the bright side the customers stopped bitching about the wait and lack of help after hearing me say all that...

  I still stayed there for another 2 years after that... why I finally left is another story.

  Sorry for the length. Even 6ish years later it pisses me off. The bullshit we were put thru by the higher ups... how can we succeed when they refuse to give us what is necessary to do so?! Why is THEIR fuckups our fault?!","Dunno if this fits, but I wanted to rant about one of my many experiences in retail",5

He gives me the form and while I'm reading it he tells me I need to do a better job at closing by getting go backs and not being on my phone. Now I was confused about what he meant when he said not to use my phone. So I just nod and leave. On my way back home I remembered. I was using my phone to put stuff back since management put me in a place I normally don't work at.

I'm not a communist, nor a socialist. Well... Kinda a democratic socialist, I'm politically confused on the economic scale.

I have a degree in economics and business management but threw myself away from that and in to healthcare because making money for the worst people in life is sickening (health care in the UK isn't nearly as profitable and is heavy regulated so please don't conflate the previous statement as ignorance over the lack of winners in a for profit health care system except board members).

Anyways, a constant theme on here is how people feel guilty over leaving companies because the company or operations will fall apart. Don't. 

A company requires both capital and human resources to substain itself and if a company if unable to maintain its tools (labour) followed by the same tools cracking and bending under pressure, well you wouldn't feel sorry for a tradesman for not maintaining their equipment, would you? 

As someone who's been in both senior management at one point and who chose to go back to the shit trenches of my fellow working classes due to sleaze at the top, you should feel no sympathy for the company and should not allow the unwillingness of others to lack the same sympathy to stop you from saying fuck off to a shitty employer. 

Let them fail. The government props up high profile companies but labour does the same for all businesses. Your participation is not optional for them. You are not replaceable when a mass movement finally finds itself snapping at how shitty our generations have it in work, in the economy and in prospects. This is a lie fed to us to divide us - regardless of your ideology. 

These are the same people who'd restrict your ability to see your family; to enjoy nice days; to chastise and belittle you for trying to take a day off due to being ill, and then put everyone at risk by having sick individuals in confined spaces.

These are the people who watch their staff eating instant noodles for lunch or watch them struggle in embarrassment over working over how far their cheque will stretch, and then instead of helping they throw over time out as some kind of gift. Fuck you, we work to live and deserve a fair wage and a good life. That stands for ALL peoples of all nations. 

Companies are not people. No matter how small. You don't get the profit of working harder or doing extra tasks. They do. You get thrown a stipend and told to be grateful for it.

Let the bastards fall. Watch them burn. Jobs aren't rare. It's a fucking myth that hasn't been true and never has been. It's based on busts and the narrative is never corrected. This time they fucked up - nature threw something at us that finally brought out the anger of the masses and cleared the rose tinted glasses of how expendable we've all become. To the extent of being put on the front line of a pandemic when the business offers nothing essential. You owe them nothing because they absolutely will never feel they owe you anything. 

If your company was a partner, think of the incidents of abuse and dehumanisation and ask yourself if you'd truly struggle to justify removing yourself from them.

I'm going to be honest - I have a strong dislike of communism, and some socialist leanings or state capitalism but I would happily stand in the trenches with the most over the top communist than have to take any more shit off these parasitical leaches sucking the life energy out of humanity and human creativity and prosperity. 

Capitalism or communism, at our level it doesn't really matter. The working classes and middle classes have no reason to war over ideology like that. We get angry and throw out shit shows at each other and for what purpose? To sell ad space and serve as a way for corporations to slogan flood whatever movement is popular at the time. 

Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm the weak capitalist. I never dreamed of a huge home or a flashy car. Just enough for comfort. Enough for my future family's comfort. But I could never sit on a million while people under me struggled to pay rent and heat homes. It makes me disenfranchised. It hurts me. Not because I am blind to what is happening but because I have spent so much of my energy to defend this system and covid finally broke me on how shitty it is.

Please don't downvote just out of disagreement. If you don't like that I'm pro (fair) capitalism then I'd rather have some kind of dialogue or someone to explain what I am ideologically when it comes to the economic scale, because so far I've yet to find something that I want to participate in.",A rant from a capitalist-supportive person,13

They don’t treat the workers like humans, just machines that get them their bonus for hitting higher production numbers.

But lately I’ve been resenting my fellow employees because I realize they are just as to blame for the intense pace and work load. 

So many people (especially young and new workers) come in and work as hard they can and do whatever they are told, even when it’s unsafe or just unreasonable. They get paid the same regardless of how hard they work and there is literally no incentive or bonus for working harder (unless your a manager). The company will convince someone to do 2 peoples job by getting them to work twice as fast and let them have a small break when they get their task done. Then they take a job away and make one person do two jobs without the break since they proved it can be done. Yet time and again I watch someone doing twice as much as needed and the company doubling the work load for that job.

I really don’t understand these people, I recently got a trades position which is a better job in the factory.

I worked a variety of retail and food service jobs before and during college. Even before covid ""broke"" the economy, the people working as managers in those industries weren't usually highly skilled or talented people. To be bluntly honest, they often didn't have better options. Retail and food service job mangers usually make only a couple dollars an hour more than the people who work for them. $12/hr as a fast food manager when your employees are making $9.50/hr is still far too little to live on. $15/hr versus $12/hr isn't enough either, but at least we're moving in the right direction. They are underpaid, over-worked, and being asked to manage a crew of the most unreliable employees in any workforce. They're being told to do all of this with in many cases no formal training in management, but a promise that there is a path that could result in them actually making a decent living wage and having a career. Most don't ever make it to those roles. In the corporate pyramid, first-level supervisors and managers are indistinguishable from their employees to those running the company. They are low-level employees who are treated poorly, paid poorly, and viewed as completely disposable.  

When I read a story on here about someone's manager scheduling them on a day they requested off, telling them they have to work because there's nobody else available, I often feel bad for the manager too. Imagine being told you have to put a schedule together for a restaurant with less than 2/3's the staff you need to cover all the shifts you need. People are constantly not showing up and quitting because the wages the owner(s) pay aren't enough to get and retain quality employees. You have no real ability to change working conditions for your people. You can be nice to them, but all the while your boss is asking you to do the impossible and telling you  ""be tough, don't take this from them."" 

Those managers have bad jobs too. The fault for the toxic work environment is much higher up the chain. It's the C-Suite Executives and Wall Street investors who think it's more important to pay minimum wage and have 99% employee turnover during a 12-month period than treating people right. Sayings like ""People don't quit companies, they quit managers"" don't hold true when entire business model of a company is to exploit their workforce as much as possible.","Reddit needs to remember that the Managers many here rant about in low-level retail and service jobs are making $2-3/hr more than their employees and have no formal training. They too are being asked to do the impossible for poverty-level wages, and are a symptom of larger issues.",502

I have never been one to call out if it’s not for an actual emergency or something is going on with my mental or physical health. (Some people call out when they’re hungover and if you do that, fuck you) Since we’re in flu season now, I’ve gotten a little sick here and there and I believe I’ve called out of three shifts since July. Pre-covid if I just have a sore throat or I’m feeling a little funky I would still work. But after going through the pandemic and getting a better understanding of the value of my health, I refuse to go in if I feel anything less than healthy. I always feel so guilty by doing so, but it has been communicated more than once to please not come in if you’re sick and you need a negative covid test in order to return.

Today my GM talked to me and pretty much asked me to “try not to get sick so often” and to “to come in if you’re just a LITTLE sick”. He said “I’m not gonna question if you’re sick or not but just remember this is a restaurant and it’s not like you can finish what you didn’t get done the next day.”

And I don’t know. That just kind of blew my mind. He’s one of the best GMs I’ve ever worked for and I really like him but that was so absurd to me I didn’t quite know how to respond.

I am one of THREE (3!!!!!!!) bartenders at this place and for whatever reason they won’t train servers to be able to bartend. So basically they’re fucked if a bartender calls out. I know it’s not my problem at the end of the day. But it rubs me the wrong way that instead of being prepared with backup, I should come in and get everyone else sick.

I stayed at this job for 6 years. It’s a local restaurant, and I spent my first few years as a line cook and the last year as a shift supervisor. The job sucked from the very beginning, with our old GM being an absolute penny pincher who nearly cried when a pan of fish fell off the counter and ate fries right out of the trash. But nothing compared to my last two years, when old GM retired and new GM (we’ll call him Rob) took over. Here’s a list of all the bullshit.

1. Rob agrees to let me start training to be a supervisor. The most recently promoted supervisor who I was kind of frienemies with doesn’t like this and does everything in her power to try and convince Rob I’m not ready. Rob overrules her in the end. 

2. Nobody takes my supervisor training seriously. I have basically two days of shadowing Rob on how to run a shift and am then thrown into the fire because we are short staffed. I have worked every position except server, so I am completely lost in that department and the servers end up training ME on a shift that I’M running. I break down crying some days because I am left alone with no idea what I’m doing. The staff is mad at me, customers are mad at me, I end up hiding in the office or stuck on the phone with Rob because I’m so lost.

3. My best friend gets hired as a carryout server. She and Rob agree on a starting wage. I notice a document on the desk in the office with her signature on it agreeing to a different wage than she had told me she was getting. She tells me she knows nothing about it and never signed it. It was forged. 

4. It gets back to the district manager that I told my friend about the document and I almost lose my job over it but she “graciously” decides not to reprimand me.  My friend wants a copy of the document and I am ordered not to give her one. The paper then “goes missing”. 

5. I got $1 raise when being promoted from line cook to supervisor. I made $15 an hour and thought that was good at the time. 

6. Management put up a paper that employees had to sign when they were late (even a minute or two). The paper was posted in a place that was visible to all staff. My concerns that the paper should be kept in the office for only management to see were ignored. 

7. When we were takeout only during the height of COVID Rob put a bottle of bleach on the counter and told me it was so the customers would “think we sanitized.”

8. During the COVID shutdown the store was run only by management and all other staff were laid off. When we started slowly bringing staff back, they only brought back who they wanted and they were all ordered not to disclose that we were bringing back staff.

9. When our store was management-run only I was allowed to keep tips as a supervisor. When we fully opened back up again I was constantly being swapped around between grill shifts, takeout shifts, and supervisor shifts. I was ONLY allowed to accept tips if I was NOT scheduled to run the shift, regardless of if I ended up helping takeout or not. If I was scheduled to run the shift I had to give my tips to the other staff. I understand managers not accepting tips but I was barely a manger. I was still an hourly employee who made $15 an hour with no benefits. 

10. My grandma was dying of cancer during COVID. I told the district manager that I may have to leave suddenly one day. She told me I was required to wait until she was a half hour out. 

11. When my grandma did die I was out for a week. I texted Rob to tell him I wanted to apply my sick time to the days I was out. He didn’t reply so I assumed all was well. I got my check for that week and it was $84 (I worked one day.) When I asked him about it he said district manager didn’t approve it because “nobody was sick”. 

12. I was CONSTANTLY bullied by Rob and his sidekick one of our assistant managers. I wasn’t allowed to voice any concerns or opinions otherwise I was told I was being “snippy” and “disrespectful” because I was half their age. I was also constantly implied to be stupid because I was often confused and asked so many questions (again I was never properly trained). Management was always talking behind my back, even to staff. 

13. An employee was allowed to stay employed after pulling a knife on a pregnant server.

14. I had to stay HOURS after close, sometimes until 2 or 3am when we closed at 10 or 11 doing a bunch of paperwork that I found out other locations don’t do to that extent. I would then get reprimanded for going over hours, but again, wasn’t
 trained properly so it took me longer. I also wasn’t allowed overtime. 
 
15. Least of the issues but they had absolute bullshit personal appearance policies that were consistent with that of a high class diner (which we were NOT). You had to have natural hair, no facial piercings (but I was allowed to put a band-aid over my nose piercing in lieu of taking it out which is even more unsanitary), only nude colored nails, no glitter in your makeup or on your nails, and no fake lashes. The policies reminded me of that episode of the Fairly Oddparents where Timmy wishes everyone looked the same and they’re all grey blobs.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been walking through the workplace at 8AM and rather than my boss saying “morning” or anything as he passes by, he just jumps straight to huffing and puffing and shooting me nasty looks and telling me what needs to be done.

Like, I get it. I don’t want to be there either, in fact I detest it, but I try to be kind at least. I’ve even tried to be positive and say good morning to ppl or ask how someone is doing to keep everyone’s spirits up and he won’t even respond - he acts angry that I even spoke to him sometimes. 

Worst part - it’s contagious. We only have 8 people at my work place and everyone of them have been becoming exactly like him. I’ve seen employees walk past him laughing or smiling a little about something and he’ll look at them and they’ll just say “oh, sorry boss”. Like what?! And now, when I smile or laugh even they look at me like I’m doing something wrong.

Is this normal in such a small business for a boss to act this way towards his employees all the time… and for them to become just like him.

It's not the Capitalist system I'm ranting about because this isn't even fair market Capitalism anymore when the Gov is essentially stealing over 50% of the people's money through taxes and other methods like parking tickets, fines, fees, ect... (ie in NY, they have a bridge where they bridge where they charge people $40 every time they cross it. They say this is for bridge repairs but we all know that money is being pocketed by some of the Deep State agents.

Basically the Deep State is a predatory banking cartel that legalized criminality for themselves so they can oppress the masses through financial tyranny. Instead of missiles, they drop bills on your head.  Bill after fucking bill. ""Work harder!"" they say and when you do work harder, they just drop more bills on your head.

It's easy to tyrannize people financially as a banker. Bankers just print money, buy all the essential businesses like energy, markets, ect... and then raise prices on everything will keeping liquid capital supplies low. This way, we all chase after the same dollar to pay our bills and this creates tons of unnecessary resentment for those who are unable to make enough money to pay their bills. I assume 80% of the world's population is in this boat.

Scam after scam. Hustle after hustle. Try to take them to court and their paid off Judges protect them. There's no point. Try to complain to the Gov and you will find paid of Politicians who work directly for them. They don't care. They just pretend to.

Now in the richest country in the world there is 28 Trillion in debt hovering over our heads with homeless people setting up tent cities? Unacceptable horseshit. It's not our fault this happens. It's the predatory 1% who sucked our wealth through their scams. They have infected the Gov too which not only makes the Gov basically worthless, it makes them dangerous to our liberties.

It's not that we shouldn't have a Gov but this band of paid off thugs cannot be it. We cannot even have single leaders or oligarchs anymore. It's too dangerous. We must learn to Govern ourselves through bottom up consensus under Common Law.

As an example, Americans have been fighting for Marijuana legalization for 75 years and Biden has the nerve to say he doesn't want to make it legal until more research is done on Marijuana. What he means is that legalizing Marijuana consumption and sales would benefit us so greatly (both financially and medically) that it would harm the Deep State's agenda to financially tyrannize us. 

I say screw it. If it's right, it's legal. We as a people decide if Marijuana is acceptable and since we do, it's legal.

I’ve worked for this company for 6.5 years. The day I came back, my supervisor was no help assisting me with regaining access back into our computer system, so I sat at the office from 8:15-1 until I gained access. 

Then I finally went to grab lunch and my supervisor is like “oh yeah, there’s a mandatory meeting from 1-3” I said “well I’m going to get lunch because I haven’t eaten today so I’ll be a few minutes late” and she screamed fine at me. I come back to the office and have to eat during this mandatory meeting my first day back. I then had to leave said meeting early because I had a session (I’m a social worker) at 3. 

I then overhear from coworkers that my supervisor was talking crap about me at the office that she wishes I had gotten more paperwork done… uh hello, I was locked out of everything until 1 and then had all these meetings you set up for me. I worked until 8:30 my first day back. I also was given crap cases from a coworker because “she worked extra while I was out” which basically amounts to my boss and this coworker are “friends” so she gets to run things and get rid of cases she didn’t want to deal with anymore. I got a case that was a month from discharging and that she had before I went out on leave, but nobody can explain how this is clinically appropriate or beneficial to the client. 

It’s only gotten worse since then and I’ve only been back a month. I’ve also been on call for two weekends now since returning. My boss just keeps loading tasks onto me while “promising to help” when in reality she won’t. 

I could go on and on about this company and how shitty they are. They constantly ask us for money from our paychecks because we’re nonprofit, but we never get a bonus for our own families, they added a two hour mandatory meeting each week right here at the holidays, they mandated the vaccine when we were already short staffed…

I’d just like to share my experiences of work places. I’m a Canadian, 30 years old. Dropped out of high school to work cause I couldn’t do school. I’d just leave in the morning. I started at 16 at Canadian Tire, warehouse work minimum wage. I worked there for 9 months. Night shift all by myself, my own manager. I ran the warehouse from 3-10 pm. One day randomly my hours were cut by half. From full time no warning at all. I accepted this and kept working. I was a great worker too, respected by my co workers, and very helpful with everyone. Hours cut again to just weekends, so I tell my manager I’m quitting. He laughs and is like yeah I get it. We go into the office, I tell my boss I quit. He asks where’s his two weeks notice, I say where’s mine for my hours cut? He says you don’t get that. I say well neither do you then, and walk out. Have my last smoke with my buddies and let them know what happened and I quit. No one believed me till the manager came out to smoke with me and explained I was done.

Now here’s the kicker. The boss wanted me to take over the managers shift in a week because he was going back home to marry his wife. My manager was an awesome dude btw. So I completely fucked my boss by quitting. He had no one to cover my shift or the managers. So he gave it to one of the morning guys. Who gets paid minimum wage, he quit in a week because they over loaded him. So my manager gets back and quits. So the other two warehouse guys quit. My boss sold that store 2 months after I left. I shafted him so hard it was great to hear. 

Now I go and work for Leon’s. this place defined slave labour. They hire people who just came here from African countries through temp agencies and have them load trailers all day long. These guys attend English school to try and better themselves, and Leon’s management at this specific place gave no fucks. I had to intervene with a manager when a guy who worked 40 hours a week was explaining how he can’t come into work on the weekend cause he had class. I’m signing things out in the office and I hear “well if you’re not here Saturday don’t expect to be here Monday” I stop. Look at my manager and go you can’t say that, you can’t do that. He works 40 hours in the week and he can rightfully tell you no he doesn’t want overtime. He cut that shit right out real fast. The other guy thanked me and we went on our ways. I quit that place when my management asked me to be supervised, and he said don’t you want to be just like me? I laughed and said no. Gave them my two weeks, he said I don’t have to, so I just left. 

One of my buddies I met in there worked for Leon’s through a temp agency for 4 years. They never hired him. He never got benefits, vacation pay. Anything. He was a slave compared to all us real employees, that’s why I called it slave labour. I have so many more stories. This was just my 3rd job so I was only 18 at this time.",Just a rant,7

To preface this, I am pagan, so Samhain/Halloween is a very sacred day of the year for me. I gave 3 brand new, shiny pennies away to a friend the day before, to help them with their own celebrations. The very next day, I was out on the bus doing errands and before I hopped off, I noticed some change on the seat. I went to pick it up. And it was 3 brand new, shiny pennies. It was uncanny and weird and I didn't know what to make of it. 
I've been seeing a lot of posts here about giving tips to essential workers and how even children know basic kindness in treating workers like human beings (the entire purpose of childhood is testing the limits of humanity, honestly), and I now know this: kindness before anything else. I give where I can because I know there are people just like me out there who are struggling. Those who are entitled don't see this economic situation as give and take. They see it as take until you're satisfied, the world is unfair. Why should the world be unfair? Why shouldn't people choose compassion knowing that what they give, they will receive in return? Transactions are the devil, I hate that the world sees everything as transactional, but if you have a supply of something you have an infinite well of, why not give it freely, even if it doesn't give you anything back but a smile?
People say I'm too kind, but why is kindness a bad thing, a weakness? And who said it has to be money?  Don't let this capitalistic hell make you feel like you can be kind only at your own expense. 
Sorry if the topic got away from me, my point is that a lot of people (mostly entitled ones) don't see that kindness is free and doesn't hurt anybody. This world could use some compassion.

Recently, I was contacted via Indeed to interview for a job. I was contacted. I didn’t know about the company until “my resume caught their eye and they wanted me to apply”. I researched the company, read some reviews (some kinda 3 star, majority good) and decided to apply. Pay started at $40K/year + commission which is something I’ve never been offered so that caught my eye (never made more than 30K/yr). It was a job that would be new to me but I’m always down to expand my skills and challenge myself with something new. 

After I applied, I was emailed and asked to answer 6 questions like “what is customer service to you”, “why should we hire you”, questions like that. After that questionnaire, I received a call setting up a phone interview. Had the interview and it went very well. He wanted to set up an in person interview. “Search us on social media to see more about our culture in the meantime!” Right…I ended up messaging one person who advertised they were hiring and she had nothing but good things to say. 

Second in person interview comes…”you’ll be sitting with a trainee, then sitting with an LAET (experienced rep) to see if we’re a fit for you but also if you’re a fit for us, then we’ll get to the interview”. That interview went okay…he said he’d forward my info to the hiring manager to set up the third and final interview. “I’ll send you an email of things you need to study for”— I’m sorry…WHAT??

I get home. Receive an email. Asks me to study their website to know the Winning principles, their values, how their company works, their acronyms and terms, the math behind how commission is earned, KNOW WHERE ALL THE 50 STATES ARE LOCATED (honestly, I could NOT look at a blank map and point out all 50 states BUT I CAN NOW!), and you must pass all three tests, provide 3 references and their emails, AND those references must answer a 50 question survey-type questionnaire about you in order for you to be considered for the job. 

When I tell y’all I studied hard for these tests because this pay was about to be life changing for me. Third and final interview comes..I pass the company knowledge tests with 100%, I pass the math test and missed ONE, I passed the states and time zone test with 100%. Went to interview with the two hiring managers and they asked how I did on the tests. Told them my results and they both looked at me and said “I couldn’t even pass like that!”……

I then learned that you’d be salary, making 40k/year (1538 biweekly BEFORE taxes) plus commission but if commission is MORE than your base pay, you will ONLY get commission (pay is NON NEGOTIABLE), it’s 9.5 hour days m-f, 26 week training (work 2 saturdays/month during training, 1 Saturday/month after training) no breaks, must be on call literally 24/7/365, meaning if a customer/driver called at 10p or 2a, you had to answer and use your personal laptop and phone to assist, had to work from home any time you couldn’t come into office, if contracted Covid, still had to work from home AND had to work 7 additional hours for the company during training but it was unpaid. 

….SIGH…there were 3 interviews… 3 WHOLE INTERVIEWS…and yet..NO JOB OFFER. i understand companies want to make sure you’re a good fit..but boy do I feel like my time was WASTED! AND..I had to pay for parking both days of the second and third interview. I just don’t understand why it takes so much to interview someone to basically learn the company as extensively as I had to all to NOT get the position that I was asked to apply for. Rant over.

I'm 21, and worked it for 1.5 years, a little more maybe, and it was awful. The clients I supported, keep in mind here, I'm 5 foot 4, 120 on a good day (less than that when I run out of money and food lmfaoo), and skin and bones essentially, but the clients I assisted were almost always double my size. They were taller, heavier, stronger, and fucking scary when they got mad. The very first client I assisted, I was 19 and depressed. This client beat the SHIT OUT OF ME. McDonald's? Hitting me. Church? Hitting me. Dollar store? Throwing stuff at me AND Hitting me. There were times my mom thought I had concussions from how I was acting. My partner was scared to even let me go to work. Wanna know how much I made for getting hit and screamed at and my car beaten up? 

12.25. That's all I was worth. I got 1 .25 raise the year and a half I worked there. One of the last times I went into the office to fill out an incident report, my supervisors and other higher ups were laughing. They were laughing about my situation. My direct supervisor saw me come in, turned to me, and said ""oh hey! We were thinking of starting a betting pool to see when you would quit, lol"" That's when I basically checked out. I had 1, maybe 2 more incidents before I broke down and screamed over the phone that they needed to get the client and never put me with them again.

After that, I worked with someone who fetishized asian women. I found out the company I worked for SET HIM UP WITH ANOTHER ASIAN CLIENT. They set him up with this Asian client, and he got so creepy, the guardian of the client had to get a protection order. The company KNEW how he was, but didn't care. Speaking of asian racism, we had a staff that made fun of asian eyes and encouraged the disabled clients to do so as well. I called the staff out on this, he goes ""well, no one here is asian so it's not hurting anybody."" Me and one other person pointed out that it was still racist if a POC wasn't there.

Before i got really sick of it, my car got broken into by an individual and they stole from me. No apologies, no returned item. It wasn't even that I got stolen from, it was just a 5 dollar pack of gum. (That I used to settle my stomach so I could eat) It was the fact that when I showed I was upset, I got yelled at by my boss. 

I got sexually harassed by another individual who did in fact know what they were doing. Tried to grab my tits, and got furious I wouldn't let him. I yelled at him to not fucking touch me. After I said I would no longer be alone with this person, they continued to schedule me alone with this person. I put my 2 weeks in.

This was all during COVID, by the way. No raise. One (1) taxed 200 dollar bonus. So it was actually more like 180 something. During one point, the department I was in was asked to make goody bags for everyone in the company. We were told they would be brought to each department and everyone got one. Cheap fun sized candy, and a miniature bottle of off brand water. The kid sized bottles you can finish in like, 1 gulp. We made over 200 of these goody bags. Guess who didn't get one. Anyone from our department. As incentive for the vaccine, they did a giveaway and gave everyone $100 (in Amazon gift cards, of course. Only Amazon here.) The giveaway consisted of a 70 in 4k smart TV, the newest iPad, and airpods. The CEO won the TV, one of the supervisors won the iPad, and one of the ""peasants"" got the airpods. I know how much those higher up fucks made. I'm dating the son of one of them. Fuck them.",Direct Care Rant,10

After reading so many horror stories about working/living here in the US, I thought I would share my worst experience. This was back in 2009 and I worked for a BBQ chain that had several restaurants in my area. I was 22 and I was pregnant for the first time. I also babysat for extra money. 

Anyway I was at my babysitting gig before I was supposed to go in to the restaurant for the afternoon/night shift. I noticed I was bleeding and immediately called the mom of the kid I was babysitting. She came home and told me I should get checked out since I was pregnant. I called my fiancé and he drove me to the hospital. On the way there I called my manager at the restaurant to let him know I wouldn’t make it in that day and that I was on the way to the ER due to vaginal bleeding. His response? “You need to find someone to cover your shift. That is our policy.” What?!? That was the last thing on my mind at that point! I told him I would do my best. I called all the servers I had numbers for and either I got no response or they couldn’t fill for me. I called the manager back and let him know that I couldn’t find a replacement and he said “ok. You will be written up for not showing today and not finding a replacement. You are scheduled tomorrow as well and if you fail to show you will be fired.” Wtf. At that point I was laying in a hospital bed in the ER waiting for an ultrasound. The last thing I wanted to do was spend time on the phone trying to find someone to cover my shift for me. Luckily a female supervisor took that over for me and I was covered for a week before I was expected to be back at work. 

I ended up being told that I was miscarrying, and was sent home. Miscarrying is a horrible experience for a woman to go through, and was made even worse due to an incompetent, uncaring prick of a manager. It sucks here.","First post here-a rant, if you will",15

I come from a family of privilege - I'm in the lower upper middle class, I'm white, and I'm a Cisgender Male. I do have severe anxiety and mild depression, but other than that I'm not in any minority groups. My mother is a far-left demo-soc (but she won't admit it) and my father is right-leaning center, so needless to say I've been exposed to a wide variety of political opinions throughout my early and mid childhood.  


I'm turning fourteen in just over a week, and as I creep closer to adulthood I learn more and more about the serious and systematic issues that plague our world. And to be honest? Despite my economic, racial, gender, and physical privilege, I think I've been dealt a shit hand.  


Crop fields will fail by 2028. The last snowflake will fall in 2050. I live in the United States, an oligarchical imperialist states that thinks it needs to bully the world into capitalist attitudes through a more powerful military force than the world has ever seen. I have the financial means and support to go to any college I could dream of and yet I know that going into hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt for a piece of paper that will let me participate in this horrific capitalist system is awful. I don't want to work forty, sixty, seventy hours a week for the rest of my life, and I don't want to support a system I find utterly miserable.  


My father preaches the importance of college, hard work, and achieving your dreams meanwhile he works 75 hours a week for dysfunctional nonprofits in a toxic, unfulfilling work environment. Frankly I don't know how he isn't a part of this subreddit. He comes home every single day miserable, depressed, and anxious about the next day. It scares me to know that in order to even be considered middle class (I know the lower upper middle class thing is a construct to divide us but i'm using it as a term here) I have to sacrifice every ounce of humanity for a fairly reasonable annual salary of about 90K/year, which is what my dad makes to support our family of four.

  
I am stuck in a place where I can take no action against capitalism, and yet every waking moment I can't see anything else but the evils it holds. Manipulative marketing, brainwashed workers, systemic racism and inequality - You name it, it plagues my every waking moment.

  
For a while I thought I was just going to move to New Zealand to escape this horrible capitalist system, but after discovering the dozens of amazing reddit communities filled with members of the working class empowering each other, sharing ideas, and taking action - I don't know what to do. I feel as if I have a responsibility to assist my comrades (once I'm no longer a minor, of course), but at the same time I just want to run away, live in a van, and do comedy shows across europe - where I won't go into endless debt because I caught a disease.

  
I truly love my comrades across every sub that empowers the working class. r/antiwork, r/CPUSA, r/socialism, and so many remind me every day of my responsibility to others, but I am simply too depressed about the sorry state of the world to enjoy day to day life.

My hobbies are meaningless. Video games are only a momentary and sterile escape. I don't have the attention span for books because my mind inevitably wanders back to the struggles of the common worker in America.

Every day is a reminder that there is no fantasy land. There is no happily ever after, no paradise, no Solla Sollew, and certainly no forgetting about the world around me. I simply can't let go of the fact that this is the world I have to work, shit, and die in forever.

I don't believe in an afterlife, so even that comfort is stripped from me. My parents won't put me in therapy.  


I'll cut it off here so I don't ramble on forever. I wish all of you the best.",Rant Alert: Me and my friends are inheriting a shit world,5

I did well in high school. Went right to college after that and got a degree in History (a subject I still absolutely love). I always worked during school, but after school I worked full time as a mail clerk at a law firm. It was such a miserable job but I liked my co-workers. Lawyers are every bit as bad as people imagine. After a few years of that, I joined (enlisted, because I am an idiot) the Army. I became a Licensed Practical Nurse in the Army (68C) and served for just shy of 6 years. I was always well regarded by my NCOs and the officers I worked under and received an honorable discharge. 

Now I want to talk about the Army a bit, but I don't want to sound like I am promoting it or encouraging people to join. Honestly, fuck the United States military for a ton of different reasons. That being said, and I am not writing this to glorify the Army, but express how shitty civilian employers are. The Army was the best employer I ever had. The pay was ok. I received free healthcare. I get tuition benefits when I go back to school. I got three meals per day (although they aren't always free). Almost all of my gear was provided. My training was provided, and actually good training. I got plenty of leave (even got close to use or lose a few times). Shit, I even got paternity leave (had two kids while in). I even felt mostly respected by my leadership. I got lucky with this, Army medicine is kind of ""Army-lite"" and I luckily worked with some cool people who actually went to bat for me when I needed them. I was a good soldier, so that helped. I also became an NCO and got to be something of a mentor to some younger soldiers, which was a rewarding experience. But still, fuck the Army. 

What I am trying to say with this is that, as an American who used to consider myself patriotic, people shouldn't have to sign their lives away in order to be treated like a human beings and valuable members of our society. I always did the right thing, always maintained accountability for myself and subordinates, and was treated well by the Army in return, for the most part. But the moment I became a civilian again, everything changed.

I ETSed (military term for finishing term of service and getting out) from the military after 3 years in Germany. I got to see how typical Germans lived. My family and I loved being stationed in Europe, but I thought I would be happy getting back home. It was a nightmare. For starters, my youngest son got pretty sick right after my final leave ended and I didn't have any insurance at the time. I couldn't get a job in the US while stationed in Germany. I was informed that I was totally on my own and there was absolutely nothing Tricare (military health insurance) could do to extend me. Thank god we didn't have to take him to the doctor, we would have been fucked. Thinking back, the only reason why we didn't see a doctor was because I was a nurse and was able to monitor and care for him. Had I not had any medical experience, I would have taken my son to urgent care. He had a concerning fever and wasn't really breast feeding, but I weighed him like I was taught on a Mother-Baby ward and let it ride a bit. It was scary, especially since we had only been back in the US for like 2 days, but his fever eventually broke.   

I am fortunate my military job was in nursing and directly translated to civilian employment. I didn't want to resume nursing as a civilian because the civilian healthcare system in the United States should be criminal. However, I had to take a nursing job because they were the only employers interested in an interview. Like, I literally allied to middle management jobs at gyms, thinking my role as an NCO would matter, but it didn't. Frankly, I think civilian employers see military service as a liability and don't like hiring veterans, but that is purely anecdotal.     

My civilian nursing job was a total shit show. I loved the physician I worked under and I really liked my direct supervisor, but the overarching company totally sucked. They treated employees so poorly, even doctors and nurse practitioners. Sadly, after about a year, I got a new supervisor and he was a total shitbag. He cut corners all the time which both the physician and I agreed was unsafe for patients and providers, but he had a masters in business, so obviously the company sided with him on healthcare matters. Its all about saving money. I eventually caught him in a lie which impacted our work. I called him out to his face and his response was to throw another co-worker under the bus. I totally lost my shit, cussed him out to his face, and quit on the spot. In hind sight, it was really unprofessional of me. But, is still had a chip on my shoulder and he went after one of my team members. I saw red. It did feel good though. 

I then got a job helping homeless veterans get housing and medical care. It was a really cool job with great co-workers. The work was good enough to make me forget about the substantial cut in pay. However, again, the agency treated the employees terribly. They didn't even have a competent HR department that could successfully enroll people into the benefits offered. I think they did it intentionally to save some money. The big deal for me was that this was during the pandemic and they refused to let us work remotely, despite it being completely feasible. This was at the height of the pandemic, before the vaccine, and it was totally unsafe to work in an office environment.  They lied to us whenever we brought it up and it became clear that they just didn't trust us to do our work without them micromanaging us. It was insulting. After a year, I couldn't accept the stress of the job, especially for the low pay, and the disrespect from my employer, so I quit. I loved helping homeless veterans. However, even working full time, I could only afford living and raising my kids in my parent's basement. My wife tried to get a job multiple times, but she has a 6+ year gap in employment because of my military service and her choosing to be a mother. She couldn't really get a job when we were stationed in Germany. Nobody would hire her despite also having a degree. Instead she enrolled in a masters program for social work. 

I recently got my third job in three years after leaving the Army. I am a health assistant at an elementary school. I cant even call myself a nurse, although I actually am. Like, I have a nurses license, but it is only an LPN. My state is phasing out LPNs. I have more experience than all the RNs I work under, since I have treated critical patients, but no one cares. I used to treat combat casualties for god's sake, now I am treating loose teeth and runny noses. The pay still sucks (worse than ever before), but I am treated so much better by the school staff and I like working with kids. Kids are innocent and they don't know that everything they are told about working hard and doing the right thing is a lie to turn them into better worker bees. But, it means something to me to help them smile during a pandemic, especially since a lot of the kids dont have great home lives. 

I have been living in my parent's basement with my wife and two kids for over three years now. The cost of living is just too expensive in my city. I couldn't move out anyway because I rely on my parents for child care. Thankfully, my wife is almost done with her masters and will re-enter the workforce soon. Once that happens, we can be adults again. I miss having pride. 

I volunteered to serve my country for absolutely fucking nothing. Six years of my life, for nothing. We would be in such a better financial situation had I never enlisted. But what really throws me into a rage is that even after serving my country, I would still be treated better as a non-citizen in Germany had I just stayed there. Seriously, we had breakfast with our German neighbors during our last week there and they explained the process of getting a visa. I would have very nearly free healthcare and the same basic education benefits I had to earn as a soldier. Not only that, their society treats their own people with so much more respect and dignity than ours. You don't even see trash on the streets in Germany. You dont see people living on the streets in Germany (except maybe a few big cities) because Germans usually take a little pride in their country. Of course, they are able to take pride in their country because they aren't treated like garbage by their employers and their government. Honestly, at this point, I would happily renounce my American citizenship and move to Germany (or Italy) in a heartbeat. Fuck this country. I gave to a country that cant even be bothered to take care of its own citizens. What a fool I am. 

Shit, I am sorry for the rant. If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I don't want pity or anything like that. To be absolutely honest, a lot of veterans have it so much worse. I have a good family life, we are a wolf pack as my eldest son likes to say. I just want more Americans to better understand how much of a myth our sense of exceptionalism really is. We leave nearly everyone behind in order to line the pockets of some of the worse individuals among us. And I want to be clear, as a soldier, I was taught that leaving someone behind has inexcusable. We shouldn't except this. We should demand more.",Thank You For Your Service (bit of a rant),18

They don’t want a population of citizens  capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well  educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in  that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests.  

Thats right. They don’t want people who  are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly  they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking  years ago. They don’t want that!  

You know what they want? They want  obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to  run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively  accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the  longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing  pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re  coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money.  They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall  Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from  you sooner or later cause they own this fucking place! It's a big club,  and *you ain’t in it!*  You, and I, are not in *the big club*.  

By the way, it's the same big club they  use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what  to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media  telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table  has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody  seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue  collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest  hard-working people continue, these are people of modest means, continue  to elect these rich cock suckers who don’t give a fuck about you….they  don’t give a fuck about you… they don’t give a FUCK about you.  

They don’t care about you at all… at all…  AT ALL.  And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Thats what  the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain  willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick thats being  jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country  know the truth.

And I just gotta say, jobs don’t pay fucking ANYTHING nowadays.

I know I’m stating the obvious here, but I’ve only been out of school for coming up on 2 years now and I’m already over it.

I knew it was bad but I didn’t realize it was *this* bad.

Literally the #1 reason I put up with all the constant bullshit at my job is because it pays better than most other places in the industry do. And even then I don’t get paid as much as I should tbh. None of us do. Even the people who have worked in the company for going on 15 years or longer don’t get paid that much more than me.

It’s all so insulting. The amount of work we’re expected to do day in and day out, to not even be making at least $20 an hour is insane to me. That’s not even a lot but it’s somewhere to start at least. I mean, I make MAYBE around $20 an hour once you factor in the fact that I work 3rd and I work weekends, but without the extra pay it’s a few dollars less than that. 

I live/work in what I would consider to be a pretty major city too, so the COL is somewhat on the higher end. All of it is just so ridiculously dystopian to me. Especially when a 4-year degree is REQUIRED for my job. YES, it is required (due to industry standards).

People often wonder why my generation (I’m a baby millennial/elderly Gen Z) and literally almost everyone else alive right now is suffering and just plain unhappy, it’s because we work 40+ hours a week and we are still broke. The sad thing is, my job is actually very important as it is medically related, I actually help keep people ALIVE! And yet it’s STILL difficult to make a proper living from it. Not everyone can or should have to become a doctor or a lawyer just to make decent money. Not to mention, those careers usually involve taking out high student loans too, which is a whole other conversation. 

People also shouldn’t have to break their bodies down and work 60 or 80 hours a week in a possibly dangerous manual labor job either. I just CAN’T anymore. Our society is gross and I’m so over it. 🙄

Also, almost everyone I know (including myself) has been working in a chronically understaffed environment for awhile now, with no end in sight. Some of us work in healthcare, education, or retail. So a wide range of industries are experiencing this. I just don’t get it. Instead of “thanking” us with food, I really wish they’d just hire more people to lighten the load, or maybe give us a raise. BUT WAIT, they’re not gonna do that because it costs too much money and it’s too hard apparently. 🙃

They don’t care about us, they only have love for their wallets.",An all too familiar rant by yours truly,4

7 days a week. 6-10 hours a day. I had to fight very, very hard to get half-days ""off."" I very rarely got full days off. 

It took the 4th largest snow storm in history to get two days off, and just my luck, I caught a cold those two days.

$1,500 base + $500-750 tips if lucky; it's a very slow restaurant due to COVID. Business is good when tourism is good (airport\highway location).

It's a family business. I'm expected to help out. But my parents treat me like garbage and tell me I'm trash to my face. 

I was always getting yelled at. Never got paid on time. Guess how much my rent was (step-dad's house)? If you guessed $1,500, my base salary, ding ding ding! You are correct. 

So I'm pretty much working my ass off to pay for rent that goes into his pocket. Tips all go towards necessities. 

Wage. Slave. 

Delivering food in a major metro area is a shitty, low-end, and boring Squid Game. Thank God I didn't get into any car accidents or got any traffic tickets. One mild event would have obliterated me. 

Tips were a complete rollercoaster 🎢. Plenty of times I got fucked over. Many, many times I went into the system and changed the delivery fee to a higher number (shout out to unethical LPTs). 

Why? Because fuck you, pay me. My parents\employer weren't paying me and neither were my customers. I'm already a wage slave. What do I care? 

And admit it, if you could increase the delivery fee on your shittiest customers who always ordered and never tipped, you would in a heartbeat. Many customers only ordered when the weather was horrible outside. I wonder why.

I quit. I left. I told them I'm not coming back. I meant it. They think I will go crawling back to them. No, can't do it no more. Crypto may be a shitty Ponzi scheme, but God damn it's made me the most anti-work money I've ever had. Literally pushing buttons on my phone.

I do not want to work 5 days a week, to only have 2 days of free time to recoup, tidy, see friends, enjoy myself. How can anybody truly live a fulfilling life when only 2 days out of the week are theirs? 

I'm coming to what would usually be the time where I chose a degree and a career path to pursue, but i'm at a loss. To me there is nothing worse than dedicating so much time and money into something that is not going to benefit me in any way other than monetarily.

I don't want to bust my ass for 8+ hours every day only to struggle to pay my bills anyway. The price of living is increasing and wages are not. Why should anybody work themselves to exhaustion, until they're too old or ill to carry on? This is not the purpose of human life yet the majority have been tricked into thinking so by people with money and power. 

One of the worst parts is, so many people don't even question it. Some people don't even consider that there may be another way to live other than school, work, die.

I started looking for new jobs and one caught my attention. It was a smaller company in another city, much cheaper than where I lived and the salary was just a tiny bit below what I was earning at the time. I thought it was worth to try just to escape my current situation and move to a cheaper place.

I started the process, spoke to them, had a couple online interviews and a test I had to work on and return to them on a specific deadline (common for my line of work). I did all of those and got nice feedback, they seemed to appreciate me as a person and liked my technical skills. The final step was an interview in person and it meant I had to go to their main office. It was a few hours away by train and I agreed on a date and time to be there. I had to book and pay for the train tickets myself.

After I arrived at the place I met some of the people with whom I had talked before and they let me in the office and to a meeting room. They were my potential boss and one of the higher ups at the company. The interview was a bit strange since I felt they only wanted me to repeat what we had already covered before... But I just went with the flow. Near the end they asked me why should they hire me. I told them about the positive feedback I received regarding my test and also that I'm willing to move to this other city only for the job plus I went to the interview with my own time and money. That was not enough for them but I wasn't aware at that moment.

Finally, they asked about the salary. I told them I wanted what the job description says and I said the amount. They looked at me with surprise and quickly asked someone from HR about the job description. They looked really disappointed. After all that I had a small talk with the HR person and it went well and they were ready to close the interview and about to leave the room. Suddenly, the higher up came back and took only me into the room again. He closed the door and told me: ""Look, that salary is too high, I can't believe you would ask for that amount. Someone like YOU doesn't deserve that amount of money"". 

I just said my goodbyes and left the place. I went directly to the train station and I was feeling depressed. I had wasted 1 month in the process, hours of my life and also money just to be treated like trash. Needless to say I didn't get the job.

I say ""real"" because I did have a job previously for several years, it just wouldn't be considered by most people to be a career and the pay was definitely lacking. So at 25 years old I searched around for a few months and finally got a job at a ""real"" business. I was so excited at first to finally be entering the work force and having a regular 9-5 that pays slightly better ($15 an hour + benefits) than what I was working for before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to today, while I don't necessarily hate what I do, I definitely don't enjoy it. I don't enjoy waking up at 6:30 every week day to get ready, drive to work, and spend half my day bored out of my mind because there's nothing to do. Some of my coworkers that I interact with the most I would describe as unprofessional at best and disrespectful at worst. My HR person had me get up from my computer while I was in the middle of a task and walk across my work station just to hand me my employee benefits number and said and I quote, "" I was too lazy to walk around to you"" with a smile on her face. 

&amp;#x200B;

My coworker/lead (it's just the two of us in our department) is often bashing our other employees or even our clients for not filling out some of the paperwork right. She scheduled a meeting for herself right at the end of my shift earlier this week and I left anyway when my shift was supposed to end because I wanted to go home. She told me yesterday that she would need me to stay late next Monday (I already come in early Mondays to catch up on weekend paperwork) to cover for her because she had another meeting. Like bitch don't schedule your fucking meetings at the end of my shift then. I start at 8am (officially) and work until 4:30pm. She comes in at 10:30am and stays until 7pm. We overlap for \~6 hours every day, schedule your shit to happen then.

&amp;#x200B;

And to top it all off, yesterday she said ""there's a possibility of the evening shift (her shift) opening up. How would you feel about switching to the evening shift?"" To which I responded that I was not interested. She then said ""Oh, well we'll talk about it more at our meeting on Tuesday"" Oh, this is the first time I'm hearing about  this meeting with our boss btw...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do at this point. I've only been here for a month and a half so if I end up quitting then I can't really add this to my resume even though it would be a big boost to it. But I hate the office culture they have there so much and I don't make near enough money to just stick it out. But if they try to force me to switch to the evening shift then I think I might just quit anyway, the extra couple hours I'd have in the morning would not be worth losing my entire evening essentially, because I'd get back so late I wouldn't have time to do anything before bed. I refuse to make my life revolve around this shit paying job with shitty coworkers that make me hate every second from punch in to punch out.

I couldn’t imagine myself doing anything else. I know my job is incredibly important to society and that makes me really proud and fulfilled in what I do. 

However, I am quite convinced that the current job description is more than one person can reasonably do. More and more things have been added to teacher’s plates over the years. We shoulder the weight of poverty and inequality in our communities. We have to deal with the consequences of a broken system as they show up in our student’s behavior and in academic deficits. 

My pet project for the past few weeks has been attempting to optimize my schedule to be able to do all the work I need to do in 45 hours per week or less (I’m only paid for 40, but 45 would be beautiful). It’s not possible. Either I end up working on a Saturday, or I put it in some looong days. I worked over 12 hours this Wednesday. The problem is that I have to be working with students 6.5 hours each day, which only leaves 1.5 paid hours each day to get all the other stuff done. And all the other stuff is about a third of my job. The lesson planning, the making copies, the organizing materials, the buying supplemental supplies, the parent communication, the meetings and meetings and meetings. It just doesn’t fit. 

Sometimes I wish I could just be working for a corporation so that a drop in my work performance would only mean a potential drop in my company’s profits and I wouldn’t have to feel guilty at all. But as it is a drop in my work performance will have a negative affect on undeserving children. I am trying so hard to find a way to balance it all. It is just too much. 

My solution? Teachers should only be with kids 4 days each week. Then they could dedicate one day and be super productive with prep, planning, and grading, instead of trying to get these things done with the frazzled remnant of a brain after a long school day. The kids could spend 1 day each week focused solely on “enrichment” subjects like art, computer skills, music, PE, project-based learning, etc. It would cost more money, of course, because you’d need more staff. But I know I could be a much more effective, much more happy teacher. While we’re changing the system, I’d also be happy to go year-round with a few 1-2 week breaks here and there for holidays. I bet we’d have more successful kids with a greater variety of skills and a lot less teacher burnout. 

Thank you for reading. It felt good to get this out.",Rant from a public school teacher.,36

But I will rant. I haven’t been a member of this sub long, but I have come around to a good piece of what they want here over a long period of time. 

I’ll start with some of the unfortunate crap going around that bothered me lately. I’ve seen a lot about how the “boomers” have ruined everything for everybody else. I was born between the boomer and X gens I guess, but my ma wanted me to be a yuppie, if you know what that even means. **Give up that thinking immediately if you want a chance to break free of the nightmare it has become for the working class in the U.S.** I get it, boomers had it better than you, but they had no choice for what they were born into, any more than you did. It’s a distraction from the real problems. 

Next up, **ditch that thinking about capitalism, socialism, communism**. There are no clear lines between these idealisms, and never has been. There are people in every one of those groups that are under the heels of the despots that run our lives. Some people have drunk the kool aid, and are far from coming around to the “real world” – and others that live in utopian fantasy just as far away. I don’t identify (yeah gross) as boomer, x’er, whatever. I don’t identify as capitalist, socialist or communist. If I had my way, I’d pirate the best of all of them. 

As some have said, **this is a class war, period**. **You have to pick a side**. Most of you just don’t realize you are and have been under attack FOR DECADES at least. Just because they only push around “some groups” with guns and violence, don’t think that it won’t someday be YOU. Stop fooling yourself about all this virus bullshit, the more people that DIE the easier it will be for the 1% to keep what they have, as they spread their blood money around to try to buy your compliance. They know they don’t need all the people alive anymore, to fill their sweatshops. Most if not almost all of them only want MORE than they already have! You better believe they aren’t worried about a virus, those MF’s were first in line for shots, and they have every resource in the world should they get sick anyway. 

We are approaching the day when 1 fat cat U.S. citizen will have enough wealth that he could give every living human in the U.S. **MORE than a whole year’s minimum wage**, a freaking TRILLION dollars. Even if you think you are a capitalist, there is no way in hell you can justify ONE person having so much, while others struggle to pay for a roof over their head. Even one having so much is disgusting, but there are more right up there with him, that hope to DO THE SAME OR EVEN SURPASS HIM. And even more behind them! 

Here are a couple things to wrap this up.

If you quit that BS job, don’t ghost those pukes, make a sign and hold that MF in the air at their business, post pictures of that shit. Exercise your RIGHTS as a human freakin being!

Organize some GD protests and get that stuff on the news. Get some partner groups to help, you know those groups that already have done or do that stuff. Make sure you got a clear and simple message, and don’t be shy, that ain’t workin. **CLASS WARFARE**. You aren’t working for scraps anymore!",This is Not a Quit Rant,5

The weekends are the worst so the owner comes in to help me deliver the food as it can get backed up pretty fast if I'm not fast enough. I can't even go to the bathroom without everything getting piled up.

Well last Sunday it got pretty bad and the owner still wasn't there even after texting her asking where she was and I was getting really stressed and the waiters and the cooks were forced to help me get everything out on time. it was bad.

about two hours after she was supposed to come I got a text. turns out she was stuck in traffic taking her boyfriend home and wasn't able to come in. I was left alone doing a two person job because she had to take her boyfriend home and was stuck in traffic because of that.

post,qg89qq,2y77d,antiwork,false,2021-10-26T14:59:49Z,https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qg89qq/new_here_thanks_for_this_subreddit_hope_a_rant_is/,self.antiwork,,"TL;DR: Nothing you don't know or haven't read before. Hitting all the ranty notes, mostly in the low range. Maybe you're doing the right thing, not reading. Also, some of the sentences are boringly long and run-on. 4/10, would heavily edit for style.

I'm doing this **on company time**, it has been **almost an entire day and I have done next to nothing**. For the past 2-3 hours, I have been reading the FAQ and supplementary material it redirects to. In the bolded circumstances, in 9 cases out of 10 -- this is the tenth -- I would be jittery with self-reproach, switching between work-tabs and nothing at all but the monitor's background image, doing the ""fuck this""/""but I have to"" dance, dreading tomorrow's stand-up meeting where we tell the others what we've done yesterday, mostly to prove we've done *something*; figuring how to inflate my JIRA time logs, and quantify things like ""research"". 

The truth is, about 80% of my work in the 10 months I've done it has been flipping text-states in a database and referring colleagues to excel sheets they don't know where to look for. 

I am a game writer, and I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't this.

Not everything has been like this, of course. I got to write a bit of branching narrative -- only it turned out I'd been doing it off-spec for two weeks and there was a mild few-day panic until it turned out it's okay after all, and that only because writing is, in fact, not very important to the kind of game we are making. It's big, almost AAA, and a turn-based strategy. Also, it's based on a cornerstone of Western literature, but who cares, as it turns out. As main Text Person (my job didn't have a title until I came on), it's mostly about flipping text-state switches and putting in/taking out commas and awkward phrasing in tooltips.

I came to this job from a previous one writing spam letters and text for websites promising penis enlargement, reverting baldness, facial rejuvenation, etc. At some point, I was doing literally nothing for weeks on end -- there was nothing to do, except show up and leave on time, as a couple of middle-managers pointedly told me the times when I broke that rule. Yet, the threat of something *possibly* happening was always there, as was the The Monitor-Peek Head Twist, watching if they watched me, a dance move that I engaged in possibly a lot more frequently than my managers, but probably just enough given my trouble with generalized anxiety.

It paid somewhat decent middle-class wage for the country I'm from: Eastern European, post-Communism, head-down and balls-deep in post-Communism rule by former Communist yes-men and enforcers. And so, a new move in my repertoire, the Self-Class-Conscious pirouette of ""But it's more or less free money! Just use your time well while in the office! Why can't you do it? Stop turning your head all the time, stop having trouble breathing when you think about it, enough of the YouTube rabbit-holes to take your mind off of the enormous gentle palm crushing you to dust in your chair! It's a blessing, really!""

And so for six years, that blessing. 

Anyway. Covid hit, they pretended to be closing down, and in fact kept going, downsizing by 2/3. Provided the moral fiber of our bosses, it was amazing we even got 2 months' pay as compensation.

For seven months I took freelance work as translator/editor of books, which was in fact my first job after college, for quite a few years, before I couldn't stand it, barely making ends meet -- the pay is comical -- from working on moronic self-help books and airport thrillers. In those seven month, I got a taste of that again, and it seems my taste buds have a sensitivity to shit that's impossible to dull and just put my head down and get on with it.

This place is a definite step-up. For one, I've always wanted to try my hand at game development, particularly narrative design and interactive writing. Also, not a few of the people I actually like, and the rest I mostly don't understand, instead of disliking. (The more technical people, for instance, which I nevertheless have great respect for.) 

And yet. In some ways nothing has changed. The anxiety is even bigger in some respects, because teamwork is much more of a thing, which means people both depend on you more and are a lot more attuned to anyone not holding up their end, even when there's barely an end to hold, one must be *busy,* or must appear so, as a colleague told me, advising me to have some work-related thing always open on one of the two monitors. Also, there *are* people here, a lot of them, that actually do a whole lot. You can imagine how a large software product would have positions that keep much busier than the one responsible for writing occasional text flavor and fixing typos. And yet -- management looks at the charts and numbers, and I'm probably charting pretty low on both.

The pay is marginally better than the penis-enlargement thing, and yet it is not enough. It is not enough because I live with my girlfriend and her son, and neither of them have a steady job. She used to be a marketing/sales manager, but at some point she couldn't live with herself and decided she would cook for people. At some point, she decided to open up a Bar&amp;Diner, partnered with a couple of her friends, was happy for a few months though she gave herself zero salary, until it turned out ""friends"" and ""people to do business with"" are often not the same thing. She took it really hard, as well as taking out a punishing loan to cover losses; but she pulled through and she's doing themed-cuisine picnics and private catering, despite the siren call of management work. She is doing exactly what people on here talk about, and I will not take that away from her. 

Her son has emotional issues, is a recovering alcoholic and struggles with accepting the world as it is (he's been steadily taking and leaving jobs at fast food and food delivery, two heavy slave-wage offenders), coming more or less from the exact starting point as this subreddit. 

It is kind of difficult to see a way out for myself, to be honest. I've been playing the ""working stiff"" part for quite a long time now, while not feeling well in it at best, and at worst, going through a six-month bout of major depression at one point in 2017. Jury's still out whether I've ever gone out of it. I can't say I've changed the punishing attitude I have towards myself in relation to work. Maybe it's a bit better. Maybe.

Still, I am glad to have found this subreddit, where I've found validation for a lot of things inside my head, if maybe not solutions. Anyone who's reached the end, thanks also. I don't think I've ever verbalized that stuff, so if nothing else, this was a good and maybe a necessary experience.

Peace out, or whatever young sign-off thing is trending right now on the tiki-taks. I'm young and trendy, and you better believe it.",New here. Thanks for this subreddit. Hope a rant is okay.,7

I worked 7 of those years on third shift, including weekends so that a spot in first shift would finally open up. I dropped from a supervisor, meaning a pay cut, in order to get the coveted Monday through Friday schedule.

My uncle owns a pizzeria and he says this all the time. It’s just ridiculous. His definition of “doesn’t want to work” goes something like this:

1. Doesn’t consistently pick up other people’s shifts and come in on their days off

2. Uses their sick days

3. Demands extra pay when they stay late

4. And the big one the makes me crazy, he gets mad that these people won’t make sacrifices like cancelling plans or shortening trips when he needs them at the pizzeria.

Here’s something for all of you employers out there. If you pay someone minimum wage, the possibility of them going above and beyond for you is also at a minimum. Especially if you think that “having a job” is a reward for going above and beyond, people don’t want to be taken advantage of. People aren’t just going to break their back for you, there are tons of minimum wage jobs out there and for a lot of minimum wage workers they are more important to you than you are to them. 

One more thing, I get that the one economy is bad. We’ve all taken hits. It’s complete bullshit that employers think that it’s on workers to take pay cuts or work for free in order to keep the business afloat. The pandemics not their fault and if your business needs volunteers to stay afloat then maybe you don’t know how to run a viable business.

Store closes at 10 and it was 9:50 at the time so I had to go and grab the order. Decided to take it out to my car since I figured why not, not like I can get any work done and I didn’t want to leave my items unattended to grab my things in my locker.

I come back inside before they lock the doors, and get greeted by my horrible store manager.

(For context, she’s someone who is only the manager of a store because of the amount of time she’s been there, not because she’s more qualified then anyone else. Everyone hates her, in fact at one point they did a sort of “What do you like about this or that Manager?”, to see what people thought, and EVERYONE tore into her about how terribly she treated them.)

Conversation goes roughly like this:

Her: Hey what are you doing?

Me: Oh I had an online order and wanted to put it in my car.

Her: Okay well are you on your break or clocked out?

Me: Well no, but I’m… (she cuts me off)

Her: So you realize that doing that can be considered time fraud correct? Are you aware of that?

Me: I was only out there for maybe 2 or 3 minutes…

Her: Unless you were on your break or clocked out you shouldn’t be outside the store not working, understand?

Me: Yeah I get it…

Her: Okay good, now make sure to do better. *Walks away to lock the automatic doors*


You know, I know that I was technically not working while on company time, and I would totally understand her position… if this had been a situation where I had been gone for an extended period of time. But no, anything that is even slightly not directly by the books to her is worth demeaning me. All she wanted to do was flex her position of power on someone who could do nothing about it but sit there and take it. You can tell that she hates her life so she has to make sure everyone else hates their lives as well so she can feel better about herself.


I don’t plan on quitting since I do like the majority of the people who I work with, but situations like this, and similar posts posted here, really make me question why I even bother.",Just wanted to rant a little bit about how my Store manager decided to demean me for the SLIGHTEST issue.,11

My dad is an execute VP at a local but rapidly expanding business in our state that provides DMV and notary services with much greater efficiency (and at much higher prices) than the actual public DMV. I’m sure we’ve all had a horrible experience at a DMV before so I’m sure you know what I mean lol. 

Back in February, while I was still in college, he asked me if I could work there for a few days as a greeter since they had lost a few people due to COVID. I decided to do him this favor and work for those few days if they could let me attend my virtual classes while I was there (which they did). 

I guess now is as good of a time as any in this story to mention that I don’t really have the best relationship with my dad. And for the purposes of this post, I’ll just leave it at that for now. 

While I was working there back in February, the job was as casual and as easy as possible. Whenever I wasn’t checking people in or attending classes, I was doing schoolwork, playing games on Steam, watching YouTube videos, or otherwise getting something for my time. The owner of the entire company actually asked me to explain one of the games I was playing to him one day. They were all chill with it.  The pay was a meager $10/hr but since I was really only doing it as a favor for a few days, I didn’t care that much.  

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, and my dad texts me to say that a full time greeter position has opened up and that the pay has been raised to $11/hr. Again, not great pay at all, but I figured I’ve been sitting on my butt playing games all day since I graduated anyway - might as well make some money (I’ve also been doing DoorDash, but that’s VERY hit and miss). 

Well, my first day comes and I have my laptop open on my desk. Not even playing games or anything on it. I’m actually doing quizzes that are required for the job. My dad comes by, sees the laptop, and tells me never to bring it back. At this point I’m mildly annoyed, but I figure it’s not a big deal. I don’t need to play a bunch of video games at work and maybe they were just chill about it back in February since I was doing them a favor. So we’re still all good. 

Next day I get into it with a customer who was being very disruptive and refusing to follow the rules. Literally everyone else who works there is supportive of how I handled the situation (including the owner of the entire company), and another manager actually backed me up and snapped at the customer. But my dad is, again, the only one who gives me some mild grief about it. Again, not a big deal. Probably just covering his bases and making sure the office knows he’s not playing favorites or anything like that. 

Here’s where I start to get pissed off though. 

The next day I just casually mention that I had been bringing a book with me to give me something to do whenever there’s nothing to do. The store is open 8 hours a day and we have maybe 150 customers a day at most, so there are several points throughout the day where there’s literally nothing to be done (especially after lunch where we get significantly fewer customers than we do in the mornings). I also only deal with each customer for maybe 5-10 seconds each because it is very easy for me to get their information and check them in quickly. Pops starts giving me this huge spiel about how all I need to do is sit there and do nothing and get paid for it. Telling me I have the easiest job in the world and that I get paid to do nothing (part of the problem IS doing nothing for long periods of time. I’d like to be doing something at any point during the day and not feel like I’m wasting a third of my life every day). He also starts going off about how you always have to be nice and smile to the customers no matter what they do (something NOBODY in that office does. Everyone claps back at rude and disrespectful customers, and that’s another part of the reason why I was willing to take the job).

Today I just said screw it and put earbuds in. I didn’t even particularly feel like listening to music but I needed SOMETHING to alleviate the boredom. The owner saw me wearing earbuds the other day and didn’t have any problems. We just had a casual conversation about that very same belligerent customer while I had them in. He paid them absolutely no mind at all. But if I get any more grief or micromanagement about it or anything else that I do. I’ll probably just say fuck it and quit on the spot. I’m not going to sit in the same spot for 8 hours straight doing absolutely nothing other than staring at the wall for 75% of it just for some weird power trip. 

I would like to try to at least talk to him about it before quitting if he does something again but I know there’s a 99% chance that won’t change anything and it’ll just affirm my decision to quit and piss him off in the process.  If I’m gonna force myself to be miserable for 8 hours a day, I can at least go somewhere that pays a decent wage and do it there. I’m not banging my head against a wall for $11/hr. 

Tl;dr version.  I took what I thought would be a casual job for cheap wages and now I’m thinking about quitting because of family drama and my boss/dad making the job way more annoying than it has any right to be.",I work for my dad and I hate it (rant/story).

I've applied to roughly 100+ jobs in the past 2-3 months.  
Of those 100+ jobs, I've received about:  
1 Offer  
3 Interviews  
Of that offer, I was given absolutely no training, told to just ""do the work"", had no idea how to ""do the work"" and left after I felt Management were not answering my questions, and not scheduling time appropriately (i.e. scheduling a zoom meeting and not showing up)  


Of the 3 Interviews I've been to:  
1 needed specific equipment which I did not have, which is fine, and I harbor no resentment for that.  
1 Told me I'd be a great fit and they'd let me know their decision after 2-3 days (Never heard back from them again)  
1 Scheduled an online zoom meeting, and did not show up. I waited 10 minutes after the scheduled time just to be sure. It was a no show. I was particularly incensed after I received an email saying they were sorry that \*I\* ""could not make it in time for the interview"". I just finished sending a rather SFW email addressing their lack of time management, as the time I spent for that could have been used preparing for another interview.  


Now, this is in Georgia. The positions I'm applying for are mostly WFH positions because they pay more, and quite a few have good benefits.  


I'm going to end it here, but before I do, I'd like to say that working 9-11 hour jobs will absolutely NOT cut it for a SINGLE MAN WITH NO KIDS. That's barely covering my bases, which at one point I experienced at 11H job in Texas, where I could only afford a separate room a landlord built on his property ($375, no bathroom so I had to go in the main house to handle my business).  


I don't know what everyone else is experiencing, and I'm seeing some pretty frightening things that people are posting about this current situation. People are quitting their jobs en masse, demanding better pay and opportunities. Employers are complaining no one is willing to work, but rarely show up for interviews or even let you get to that level.  


I'm upset, but it's okay to be upset. I'm upset at this broken system that believes it is okay to complain about labor shortages, when the problem lies right at their doorstep.  


I don't care about politics, I want to work. Give me a fair wage and a good opportunity, but don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining! /rantover

About 6 months ago, I took up an offer and started working at a small, family-run restaurant, and my experience has been a bit weird and rather stressful. The staff basically consists of the owner, his wife, a non-family employee (that they've known since like forever and is a family friend, so basically family), and me.

At first it was really good. They were patient with me and explained to me how to do things, which I appreciated. The work environment was also good and everything was going fine.

With time, I realized that they also kinda treated me like family, and that's not something I enjoy very much from a work perspective. First of all, they expect me to be available most of the time and never give me schedules. I always get notified like at 10pm that I have to work the next day. Also, they take things very personally whenever I don't agree with something, and the boss takes kinda the ""father"" role, and always enforces everything in a way that resembles the classic ""do it like this because I'm your father and I say so"".

Whenever I make a mistake or do something in a way they don't like, it's also really weird and makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. They kinda just get mad at me and don't talk to me instead of telling me what I did wrong. 

Another thing is that I'm only working part time because I'm attending university at the same time, but the other employee always seems to give me subtle hints that I don't work enough or whatever. He's always saying ""oh, what a nice life you have. You come to work a few hours then you go home"" or ""don't you wanna work more? you could talk to \[the boss\] about it if want to"". He's done it quite a few times and it drives me nuts whenever he does it.

Idk, it's really frustrating to 'be part of a family' at work, and it's also kinda stressful because responsibilities aren't taken at the work level, but at a more personal level, and that is kinda shitty.

At least 10 people/day complain to me about how no one wants to work. Or they'll say something like ""At least you're working! You can't say that for many people anymore!""

As if on top of bullshit pay/treatment damn near everyone has to endure to even be employed, we haven't lost a big percentage of our population due to a pandemic that is not even over.

Who the FUCK wants to work when no one can even live on their wages? Who wants to sacrifice their literal fucking lives to a respiratory virus to serve ungrateful locals?

The only reason I went back to work was because capitalism made me feel guilty. I was off for 18 months after I was laid off due to Rona, tried to work before vaccines, decided it wasn't worth it, then my unemployment stopped because I quit ""voluntarily,"" so then I didn't have a choice.

I work part time, minimum wage. And for what? My car payment and my car insurance. My job pays for me to have a way to get to my job. My fiance luckily supports us - being a single person with no one to depend on with a minimum wage job is useless because you can't even afford a roof over your head, so why bother?

So idk, dummies, why doesn't anyone wanna work? It's almost like the system is exploiting them during a historic worldwide health crisis. It's almost like we have LESS people to hire because a bunch of them fucking died.

What if you have chronic constipation and have to wait a couple hours until you can take a dump, until you can feel ready to function again? In my mind, you have no time to fix any problems, and obviously you have even less the chance to live your own life or have any hobbies, if you work full time.

it is lacking of any dignity, yet everybody acts like it's normal. the discrepancy.. people act like it's obvious that in normal circumstances, they are ""noping out of a situation"" they don't want to be in, like they actually value themselves, their mental and physical health, and deem themselves dignified enough to allow themselves to leave a situation they don't wanna be in. AS LONG as it's in their freetime. But at work, you're bound and gagged, forced to take any form of abuse, because usually you can't just quit, or ask for anything, you desperately wan to keep the crappy job that you're treated like crap in, becaue rarely anybody has a couple thousands saved up to keep themselves afloat for the next few months until they find a new job. and how do you even get a new job, if the way you left your old one was through your own fault? Be it you leaving yourself or being fired for some bullshit reason your old employer pins on your back?

How is it not the most soul-crushing thing, to not be able to go ""I feel unwell, I want to go home now""???????? How are sex workers or strippers looked down upon, when they (some I know at least) get to pick their times they wanna work, get to pick the clients they want or whom they want the bouncer to kick out because they were disrespectful, when they get a much better hourly wage, sell only their body, not really their soul, unlike the common employee who sells both and sometimes in much more demeaning ways than e.g. a sex-worker, and much less a stripper, with a proper system set up and proper environment? Just some examples, because I find it so ironic. the whole industry exists because men are so fucking greedy and needy for sex, they are the ""sluts"" per the common definition/context people use the word in. Yet women who don't want or need sex but do it as a job OR EVEN JUST DANCE and don't do anything sexual at all, because they're smart and professional and see the opportunity for some good cash under better conditions than elsewhere, working in the business get looked down upon, by the very men wanting to take their services and who hypocritically work much more dirty, humiliating, dumb, exhausting, demeaning and soul-crushing work than the women they shame.. And have to kiss way more ass too, be it their customers or their managers or whatever.

Sorry for derailing this whole thing.. The point is, work is absurd. work is demeaning, it kills any freedom of choice, any human dignity. you have to eat shit and if you don't like it you eat even more shit under the bridge. You can't just go home if you feel like it. That for me is the definition of being unfree. Unless I'm in prison, one thing I expect from life is being able to ""nope out"" and go home if I feel like shit. If that aint possible, or I'm expected to be a robot who is fine 24/7/365, life is pointless for me personally, and onyl valuable for those profiting off my ass.",it's unfathomable to me how this is normal.

5 days a week, 9 hours working +1 commute, and shit pay.

The feeling of giving away all your energy and will to live to work, and at the end of the month you still have a minus in the bank? Yeah not fun.

I currently started trying to get out of the regular job hell (pc technician these days, which is shite pay in a shite place) and started studying.

Bank didn't allow the loan for it, because my paychecks are not enough, and I'm constantly overdrafting, so I used my credit card to get into an even bigger debt, in hopes that in a year I'll have a normal paycheck.

But honestly, idk if it'll work. Maybe I'll be stuck in a regular job forever, I'm just so exhausted. This country sucks if you're middle-class and below.
Literally eating you each and every day if you dare to just be a middle level worker.

Fighting with my boss each time I need to do something, because it requires a few hours off (because I'm literally ALWAYS at work so anything requires cutting it off) sucks.

And fight him again because I told him I ain't adjusting my work pace. But good laugh. Try it.

Instead of living in a hunter-gatherer society or instead of stealing or fighting for resources, or instead of trading whatever item you have to gain the stuff you need, you work for it and you are paid for your work.

In simple terms, it makes sense.

But in reality, it is an unhealthy mess and it dances a slippery dance with ethics and efficiency.

The whole idea of a work related culture is so narrow-minded that nothing matters but work. You are taught skills solely for the purpose to get a job or for the higher chances of getting a job but you are get either inadequate pay for the amount of time that you put into the skills that you were given, or the amount of money that you paid for that education is more than what you earn.

So I am not bred to learn, I am bred to be a cog. I am bred to learn how to be worker. I am bred to learn how to work.

Surely, an education is more likely for me to get a better job but I am still stuck in the same trap of being just another cog who wears and tears and struggles with so much unneeded stress just to get by. 

I may have more qualifications but I am still a cog, only that it is bigger and shinier.

Then when I do eventually get a job, it is not likely to get the job that gives me satisfaction.

I know that every job has its flaws and disadvantages but at the same time, almost every job is designed in a manner where they picture it as the best option in the world but they hide so many disadvantages that kills you from the inside.

The work culture is either really unhealthy or a mish-mash of people who either are not qualified or too qualified but are there because they need money. 

Or the work culture itself is such a confusing mess that trying to make a health environment through PR or HR is either ineffective or unhealthy and the employees end up either projecting on each other or succumb to submission or end up with certain habits like gambling or drinking.

Then there is the issue of work-life balance.

Some work culture is so romanticized and enforced that work-life balance does not exist at all. It praises people who work to death (perhaps quite literally) but the reward is minimal or does not exist and almost all parts of the globe enforce this - America, China, Europe, Africa and whatever.

Long hours, unpaid overtime, little time for hobbies and other interests, lack of sleep, long hours for transport or long waiting time to get the needed replies from others, having to catch up with so many roles, paperwork or deadlines.

All these pressures and stresses when in the end, it is probably meaningless because you are not going to get a reply for a long time because either other people are too busy or they are delayed because of other meetings or bureaucracy. Or in the end, you work hard for a project but it is rehashed or reedited or you do not get credit for the work and effort that you put into because the only thing that matters are that you put in hours or the superiors only care about certain attributes or numbers.

Or I try to work as hard as I can, hopefully to have a good impression or to produce a product of quality but only to be bombarded with clients, customers, colleagues and superiors alike with toxic words and attitudes and they can mostly get away with it because theh can or because they allowed to. Then the next day comes with the same thing. And again and again

And in the end, it is a pattern of the same old crap where demand is high but the reward is low and the only mindset that matters is work, work, work.

And all of this branches out into other aspects of life - the concept of working hard for your dreams or working hard for the tiniest of things because you have to have all the necessary tools and resources to have everything fixed or pay people to have them fixed for you.

You are in a constant struggle between time, energy, finances, connections and so on.

Or I am bred to go to work, go back home, conditioned to buy whatever product becuase I am told that they make a difference but I cannot say for sure if the product is authentic or truly what they say or whether the means of how it was made was done through work or done through sheer bs effort like I said earlier or through forced labour.

Or I go back home and I am conditioned with bombardments of adverts anyday, sometimes popping up in ways that are super annoying like those ads on YouTube, where I am told and enforced to buy products either I do not need or do not really make a difference from one another, or products that I am conditioned to be dependent on, to be hooked into, to be meddled with in my mind to be addicted to and buy more and more or invade every aspect of my life or make me trapped in a loop of consumption and other messy patterns.

And other than that, the whole concept of making things go round via money does not stop there.

The demand keeps on getting higher and higher which reinforces the things that I mentioned earlier where you are demanded more but not rewarded enough.

But the demand is still so high that either people succumb to the pressure or to the greed that they either end up slowly killing themselves because of stress or end up committing unethical means of expanding their influence for more money or keep the business afloat.

Rubbing other places from their natural resources, stealing patents and ideas from others, painting market campaigns as the best things in the world when the truth is more bizarre or hidden, building up cult-like mentalities via consumerism, building up work environments where you force people to work for you with the promise of good benefits and rewards but the conditions are poor or sub-par, forced labour, child labour, little interest on other repercussions like waste, lobbying leaders to get more influence, protecting your interests for your shitty actions becuase you want to excuse yourself from justice. 

And so much more.

All of this so that some people want to continue to make money and gain even more money where they either live a life of luxury when hundreds or thousands of people work even more but gain less, or the few get caught in a loop of stress and pressure becuase they need to find more creative ways to keep the money flowing well and efficiency but either the demand is too high or there are so many limitations because of buwcracy and such or are willing to do unethical or even illegal things


And all of this ends up in a large burecractic or inefficient mess that is unhealthy or very easy to crumble and the past shows these dangers well like the Great Depression and the 2008 Financial Crisis.


.... but in the end, it is the only matter that is closest of something that works because without the money, I cannot have a house, electricity and food and so on.

But I cannot think of anything else but work.

And it is like the only thing that matters. 

And it is like I only live to work and that's it.

5 days a week. If not more.

40 hours a week. If not more.

Little time for anything else and the worries that come to mind are finances, taxes, bills and so on.

It is a trap that we continue to dig deeper into the more you aim to do anything about it","This is a rant. I hate work. The idea of work culture is unhealthy, overly romanticized and bloated and pursued with inefficient means or means that are questionable or with means that reinforce the attitude that the only thing that matters is only work and everything revolves around it.",27

Hello my fellow anti workers, forgive me for being long winded; but this rant is due. 

TLDR; I’m disabled, fell down at work; boss laughed at me. Walked off of the job after being there for over 12 hours, got fired, and HR isn’t your friend… especially when they are cheating with your supervisor. Never get talked into doing unpaid overtimes and working holidays due to your coworkers/supervisor inept skills. 

Well, I suppose this is going to be my first and longest post on reddit. To start things off, a little about me; I’m disabled, walk with a cane due to a limp (due to damage to my spinal cord), and I love working with and around computers. Networking, active directory and policy management, malware removal, penetration testing, network hardening, and even down to the nitty-gritty of building and repairing computers. Of course, I’m hard-headed… my disability never kept me from much, other than walking, and the doctors I was seeing at that time deemed me fit for a handicap placard. Yay! Thanks for the free parking, doc!

About 6 years ago, I was let go from a pretty bad situation. I was on the mend from spinal surgery and due to some bad filing of paperwork, I was left out of renewing disability income. I found a job immediately, It’s work I’ve previously done, managing data and records. The people who were supposed to be training me, didn’t want me there; they wanted their friends from other branches in there. So, a non renewal of contract and unemployment kept me searching for better opportunities. 

Fast forward to almost running out of unemployment, I finally found the job I was waiting for. It was simple enough, just basic run of the mill entry level support desk. Then I was told by this company, that the position wasn’t available anymore, and due to newer requirements the position was changed to network and system administrator; all of which matched my current abilities, and I was brought on board. The pay, of course, wasn’t great. 

I thought I’d stick it out for a year or two, learn a few things and grab a few certificates and be on my merry way to bigger and better things. 

Now, my dear readers if you are still paying attention; don’t ever be afraid to walk off of the job or refuse an offer after accepting it for any red flags. Realize this dear reader, moon-walk out of that situation for any red flag you see. 

The first red flag, hiring and not knowing the law. As I am on pain management medication, that can cause a false positive for pre-employment drug screenings, I let my employers know about this. It saves a massive headache, and they can fax my doctor’s office and verify that I’m taking pain management medication and for what purpose. The drug screening place they were contracted through didn’t accept the fact I was taking that medication, and left it off of the paperwork. 

Of course, I got a call back stating I failed the drug test… from there it was a 5 minute phone call with the only lady who worked in human resources and we will call her HR. HR said they would take it up with the board before they hire me. OF course, when one of the board members saw it, my reason for taking it, doctor’s notices, and all of the paperwork; I was told “I guess it ok that you take it, as you already explained your disability and need for that medication. And since you were honest with us, we are glad to have you on board.”

I have no idea how many laws were broken just at this moment in time, but I’m fairly certain quite a few were. 

I should have run for the hills at this point in time… even asking where I can park, as it was a “first come, first serve” parking, and I was scheduled for a later shift than anyone else, I had to park in the back. Management got to park near the front, but a person with a handicapped placard and obvious mobility difficulties was told to park in the back. When I confronted HR about this, I was told, “employees park in the back!”

Now, onto the second red flag, and the meat and potatoes of this story. I don’t live in a small city, by any stretch to the imagination. I would have to guess, there would be about 300,000 people living in and around the surrounding area including outside city limits. Of course, when dealing with small to medium sized businesses, a certain amount of cronyism and nepotism will start to develop. One of these cases was the brain dead IT worker, we will call him BD for short. 

BD was related to a board member, a few co-workers, and one of the senior management. BD did “well enough” on employee reviews, that they just got tired of him in one department and sent him to another department. This, after 15 years, landed him in IT. Did he know anything about IT? no. Did he know anything about computers? no. Did he know how to make a new plug for a network cable? Definitely not. Was he friends with his supervisor? Yes. With HR, Yes. Was he just there for the paycheck? Yes, and he stated this fact on several occasions. 

His major solution to everything was rebooting the computer. Reboot it until it either started working, or stopped working. Then, if that didn’t work, call someone else and offload work. Would he pay attention to what was going on at that point in time? Heck no. ESPN sports center on his phone was a much better option and had his fullest attention. Was there ever a point in time that he had to do any mandatory IT based training, H E double-hockey sticks to the naw. Why was he kept on board? He was my supervisor’s best friend. 

Of course, this being a small to medium sized company; people have to wear many different hats. Somehow, our department got merged with maintenance. Needless to say, we were an IT staff of 3; and somehow it became an army of me fixing problems all the time. 

Now, one of the main reasons I was brought onboard was to be the person who bridged a bunch of gaps in knowledge. …and a warm body to answer the phone and troubleshoot when everyone took vacations. Supervisor told me this, and I was given pretty much free range of anything and everything. Something needed to be implemented, do it. Something needed to be fixed, do it. Basically, over the course of 5 years; I was everyone’s first call for everything.

I was even doing jobs outside of my job description, and scanning in paperwork. I didn’t scan in much, because I was either at my desk doing remote assistance or off at a job site getting someone’s computer back online.

This happened due to a variety of reasons, I was always at my desk and answered my phone. Supervisor told me, “I have other important things to do”. BD IT guy was out half of the day, driving around and delivering supplies to various locations and other maintenance related duties. When a problem arouse at any location while he was there, he would work on it. Of course, you know how this went; “high school group project”, look busy and click the mouse on random areas of the desktop. When he couldn’t get it resolved, he would call me. On my off time, at doctor’s appointments, and at other random times when I was scheduled off; my phone would ring. 

This led to the catchphrase, “call the\_damned\_dan, he will know what to do”. Lightbulb broken, call the\_damned\_dan. Forget how to code in your door key code, call the\_damned\_dan. Forget your password for a website that I had no access to, call the\_damned\_dan. You get the picture. I was THE go to guy for everything. 

Due to poor maintenance, lack of migration cleanups and whatnot; there were always several ongoing issues. One of these issues was anti-virus management. My supervisor, in his infinite wisdom stated that we didn’t need any antivirus measures on any of our servers. “Only users can infect networks”. Of course, this led to a major outbreak and took many hours of resolving the issue before out network became virus free. I was told to lie to everyone about the ongoing issue as it “wasn’t major.” No idea if I broke the law at that point in time, but there was an unreported data breech; I was informed that no one need to know about it. 

Simply put, a bunch of cyber security protocols were never implemented, “because it was easier that way.” …this would come back to bite them in the butt.

At this point in time, I started to experience major burn out. I started having massive panic attacks due to lack of sleep and overwork. My pain levels were at an all-time high. I wanted to do the right thing, and bring it up to my supervisor that I needed help. Not just extra training, but a full set of extra hands. 

“Oh yeah” he said, “we get moved over to our new location, we are going to bring on a new IT Person.” 

Cool! Cool! Cool! I thought, then I asked, “So, will I be a supervisor?”

He replied, “no, we need to bring in a project manager.”

I asked, if this is something I’m already doing, and talking to vendors about ongoing issues and planning upgrades, why not promote me and hire another network administrator? 

He replied, “you’d never be qualified to do this in your lifetime.”

I snapped back at that point in time, “Wow, that struck a nerve.”

Needless to say, he retreated back in his office and shut the door for the remainder of the day. 

This was the 3rd and final, red flag. This isn’t baseball, there shouldn’t be three strikes. 

Now, I’m sure why everyone is asking themselves; why didn’t you make a complaint? It wouldn’t have mattered. There was grapevine talk of how my supervisor was having an affair with HR.

It was time to move on. I originally planned in 2020 to look for other opportunities, then covid hit. It hit our area hard. Since we do a lot of on site person to person transactions, a lot of our staff was hit. We were considered “essential workers”, and required to show up. Management remotes into work, and we had to show up. To say the situation was FUBAR’ed, is going beyond that descriptor. They allowed many to go maskless, and didn’t require staff to wear masks. They put everyone’s health and pay on the chopping block, except for their own.

We used to get annual raises, and semi annual bonuses. Since I was on a first name basis with a lot of fellow coworkers in accounting, they told me the management and board voted to stop pay-raises, and to halt new hires… for anyone below them. Since everyone was working half hours, and half-staffed at all our locations, this hit everyone hard. If it weren’t for the government bail-out checks, a lot of my co-workers would have defaulted on their mortgages and car payments. 

Of course, walk outs happened. And more new management staff was brought in, while everyone at our locations were short staffed. Management’s solution? FREE PIZZA! Potlucks! Also, during the hight of covid, to throw an extravagant Christmas party during the height of covid… that was quickly canceled when people saw covid was here to stay. 

Fast forwarding to a few weeks ago, a major ransomware hit us. It hit us hard, and fast. I put in the details on how to fix it to my boss and our vendor (his bestie) months before. I was told, “don’t worry about it, if you can’t get it fixed; we are going to be moving to the new location shortly. I need my vendor’s attention elsewhere.” This vendor, of course, handles our day to day firewall needs and updates. To say they were never done, is an overstatement. They were never done on time, and the licensing was always out of date. And of course, I never had access to the license to update any of our firewalls. 

I asked for help, I was told this was my own show. I had a previous writeup that stated I never asked for help. I was going to make sure that never happened again.

I worked tirelessly to fix this problem, constant scans, setting up a new antivirus server because the old one was corrupted. And was pulling 20 hour days for a week solid. At the end of the week, I collapsed while moving equipment right in front of my supervisor when he was drilling me about what was being done. 

The conversion is as follows, “Is everything scanning? What’s going on, how are they getting through.” 

“Yes,” I replied, “My current knowledge and understanding of the situation is that they are attacking though…”

WHAM, I hit the floor, HARD. My leg gave out due to stress, exhaustion, and overexertion. All while carrying a monitor to check some systems that ran headless (without a screen attached). 

My supervisor laughed at me. I asked, “Did you find my pain and suffering amusing? Am I a joke to you?”

He replied back, laughing, “No, it wasn’t that. You have no knowledge.”

I stayed there, for a few more hours, having started work at 3AM, I needed to be sure I covered my 8 hour shift. I messaged HR about the fall, stating I was going home, I was exhausted, and to ask my manager about it. 

Of course, I cried. Talked to my wife, aunt, cousin, mother in law, and great grand mother in law… and they told me to just make plans to leave. I had already have some interviews planned, and coming up; now was the perfect excuse to move on. My great grand mother in law told me, “son, I don’t want you working for someone as evil and hateful as that man; he wanted you to fall because that’s the only thing that brings him joy, other people’s misery.”

He never reported it, even denied existence of it happening.  

HR messaged me back, stating I was on paid administrative leave until the ongoing investigation was over. I was fired two weeks ago. Of course, they had to hire outside help to solve the issue. The vendor (supervisors bestie) helped and covered up his mistakes. Things finally got patched. I was blamed for the whole situation, even with the evidence stacked in my favor and my reports. 

Now, why did he deny it and HR never looked into it. I was told a while back, that HR Lady and Supervisor were having an affair. No one could really prove anything, except that it happened in one of our garages with a set of cameras only he monitored. They’d always take their breaks and lunches together, and would always “talk” with their offices doors shut. 

Now, I’m not the one to believe in conspiracy theories; until I caught a glimpse of her shade of lipstick on his shirt collar. 

In passing, I said, “nice shade of lipstick you got on there.” 

He replied back, nervous as hell, “Oh, that’s a cherry doughnut!” (He’s a hard core diet fanatic, and against bread and gluten) while quickly wiping it off of his lips. 

“Get it on your shirt collar there too, right by the ear Bub?” 

Needless to say, embarrassment was quickly shown upon his face. The shade of red he turned matched the shade of lipstick of HR. HR quickly walked away.

If it also weren’t for monitoring the content filter after a hardware failure, I would have never found my supervisor’s unblock for the website… HINT HINT, their motto was, “life is short, have an affair.” After that moment in time, I finally understood why he was “too busy” for any actual work. 

HR won’t save you kiddies, especially when they are having an affair with your supervisor. 

This job abused me, and wore me down; in mind, body and spirit. I kept having to cover for my supervisor’s and coworkers’s inability to solve problems. I worked unpaid overtime and holidays, and never got so much as a thank you. I never had time for hobbies unless I called in sick.

Life is WAY too short for people like this. Leave while you can, find some place that treats you right, take up a new hobby… or just go do nothing. When is the last time anyone bragged about doing that?  

Other than getting fired, and the tremendous amount of pain I have been in for the last two weeks; things are going better than they are before. My pain is back to a manageable state. I got accepted for the masters program at my first pick of school I applied to. My wife’s business has started kicking off into high gear. And, best of all; my energy levels have kicked into high gear; I finally got most of the small renovations done around the house. 

I hope everyone in r/antiwork is doing well, and remember; HR isn’t your friend, and never do more than you have to.","Bad management and HR, this long rant is due.",20

We’re a logistics and distribution company, so supervisors (like myself) are salaried at 3, 12 hour days/ week. When COVID hit in March, they immediately cut my team from 12 people to 8. Didn’t need the extra transportation staff. With 8, I might have to print some paperwork at home, spend 6 extra hours a week coordinating from home. Fine, whatever. Then, in October, they cut us from 8 to 4. Woah. Suddenly, work started getting backlogged. Complaints hit the company line. Can’t tell you how many times I had this conversation with clients. 

“Why aren’t your guys here? They’re three hours late.” “Sorry sir, we’ve been hit by COVID pretty badly. We’re (x) number of days behind and will get to you as soon as we can.” “That’s bullshit, everyone’s getting hit by COVID. You guys need to plan better.” 

Good grief. I thought, some people just can’t have patience. Things slowed down a bit over the holidays, so I didn’t think it was going to be an ongoing issue. In March, when things started to pick back up, they hired 2 new people. Not my old team members, as I had requested, but two random new guys that my team and I would need to train. Odd, I thought. Come to find out, on the second day of their training, that they are being paid $17 an hour. My current guys, $21. That’s when it started to click. My old team, the guys I had spent 3, 4 years alongside…were being replaced. In July, work finally started to reach pre-COVID levels. 6 people would just not be enough to keep things going. Management said, we will begin hiring in August. August came, no hiring. Work is increasing. One of my team members had a kid. When he requested to take time off, my boss told me “Of course, let him have his time off.” Two weeks later, my boss told me I needed to let him go. I fought for him. I fought my ass off. Said, “no way, we have to support him.” Boss said something to the effect of, you’ll do what I say of you’re fired too. So since then, I’ve been plotting my way out, and yesterday sent me over the edge. We’ve started getting complaints again because our work traffic is so high. And guess what I heard yesterday when I asked my boss to start hiring. “Management likes the payroll structure and how things are scheduled right now. So you need to figure out how to tighten up  that ship you’re running and get us back to 2019 status. We pulled in 2 and a half million that year. We’ve got bills to pay and loans to pay back. I’m figuring that out. You figure out the office.” So. You want me to run my guys 80+ hours a week in a staggered pay structure, my at 60+ hours a week, and you’re bringing in untrained guys for less money to cut your line. So I asked for a raise, only logical, because they’re paying less in payroll now. But the bottom line is never good enough. So my remaining 4 guys and I are leaving. We’re sick of the injustice at work and being forced to work until the drivers report having tendinitis in their feet and spasms in their back from driving or sitting in a van so much. We’re sick of not being able to go to the doctor the days after work because we don’t have insurance. We’re sick of standing in line at the local Wendy’s because we don’t have time to make dinner with our family. We’re just sick and tired of being sick and tired.

I'm scheduled an average of 41.5 hours a week, so after breaks I get 39 hours. No benefits, despite being scheduled over 40 a week. Funny thing is, last year (when ""nobody wanted to work"") they had me working an average of 45 hours (still no benefits).

4 years ago I was working in a Franchise Fast Food restaurant. I had worked my way up to qualifying for shift management within my first year, however, due to changes in management, I wasn't trained to be a shift manager, and instead had the position pass from me to someone the new GM had just hired. I though ""No big deal, there's still an open spot for evening shift."" So I worked for it, I went in on my days off, pulled 12 hour shifts like they were going out of style, performed maintenance that should have come with increased pay, even used my own vehicle for deliveries to other restaurants without compensation, sometimes even off the clock. Half a year later, I'm ready. Shift management is in my sights... until the manager hires this other woman, not even 20 years old and serious chip on her shoulder. As in, gave no fucks about cussing out the manager, district manager, even customers. And she would always get away with it. She, the most unprofessional person I have ever had the displeasure of meeting, became MY shift manager. I couldn't do it anymore. So one day, she started cussing at me because I had moved an order in drive thru to a waiting area. I threw down my headset, signed off of my register, pulled my til, and told her to ""have a good fucking night. I'm done."" On my way out she shoved me from behind, and I would have had every right to retaliate and defend myself. But I didn't, I walked out that night. A few days later I was called in by my GM. I wasn't getting fired. Instead, she wanted to ""discuss"" what happened. Long story short, I was painted out to be the bad guy.

Conservatives: “Foreign workers are steeling our jobs” 

Also conservatives: “lazy liberals don’t want to go back to work and now we have a food labour shortage” 

Canada made it a lot harder for foreign workers to come into the country during covid (travel restrictions, etc) and rightfully so because we are in a pandemic but how is it, that people (mostly conservatives), think it’s acceptable to complain about foreign workers doing jobs that THEY DON’T WANT IN THE FIRST PLACE and then also get to blame the liberals for there not being anybody in those jobs any more. 

People are so damn entitled that they can’t be a little more patient and wait in line for their coffee in the morning, get up a little earlier cause they know there will be a line. But no it’s not the fault of conservative capitalism, it’s the fault of the liberals and socialistic ideas some how.

My society nowadays seems to go like this: you have to work and earn at least £600 per month (that's probably 20 hours a week on minimum wage?) IF you have a partner (if you don't, and you don't share a house with anyone, then you'd have to work a lot more than that), earn even more if you care about saving for things to improve your life/ pension, and you also have to make sure you get enough exercise, buy groceries, prepare healthy meals (lest you quickly spend all your hard earned cash on ready meals/ eating out), get enough sleep, socialise enough so you don't get lonely, drink enough water, resist all of the unhealthy and addicting things in the world which are propogated by other companies where 99% of the work is done by people who are in the same situation as you, remember to relax! because stress is a killer! you have to keep your house clean, wash the dishes, do aaallllll the other chores, some people say you have to put work into your friendships and relationships for them to be successful (although I'd argue that if your relationships/ friendships feel like work then they're not good relationships), oh and now BP, a damn fossil fuel company, is telling ME to reduce my carbon footprint, you have to live in this culture where everyone drinks when they socialise (in the UK anyway, and this makes everyone stupid) and put up with alcohol poisoning, and meditate. And if you can't handle all of those things, then you'll get stressed/ worried/ depressed.   


""But capitalism produces things at such a high rate"" yeah but at the cost of every worker being miserable and unable to properly enjoy the services/ products that are produced in the society.

This is a bit of a pessimistic rant, so I'll change the tone a bit:  


Look, if we do all of these things, then we'd probably have a decent life. BUT, everyone falls short in some way or another, which results in everyone feeling like they're not good enough/ that their problems are all self inflicted. It might seem like I'm making these problems sound worse than they are, but really, I think we're all just used to living with these problems, and we need to realise that these problems are not ""a natural part of life"" or unavoidable. There are loads of things we can do, and loads of ways our system could change, to make our lives easier. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with all that pointless/ counterproductive work we're doing. First of all, there's obvious addicting things like sugar and fast food, which usually end up making our lives worse (same with alcohol for some people). But also, do we really need thousands of different companies making shampoo? I suppose if they all offered something different then it'd give people options to suit their preferences, but really it's mainly just companies selling pretty much the same thing competing using marketing strategies. Obviously, one way this is counterproductive is that adverts are annoying and manipulative, and therefore anti-public, sometimes to the point where the work being done at the company is having a net negative effect on the public. Now, if a company is having a net-negative effect on the public, that indicates a catastrophic, and completely ridiculous flaw in the system. People are working, spending a large amount of time, energy, mental/ physical wellbeing, doing something that overrall makes the world a worse place. So then it'd be better if they stopped working right? No, because they NEED to get people to pay them for something so that they can afford to live. If there are no essential jobs that need doing, then maybe we should just not make them work? I'll come back to that\*. (Also, the carbon footprint/ usage of resources/ destruction of nature needs to be taken into account when judging whether a company is truly having a positive effect on society.)

&amp;#x200B;

Employment rate (and GDP for that matter) is a really unhealthy way of judging the prosperity of a society. For example, slavery kept people busy, didn't it? and it probably produced a lot of GDP, but obviously, there were some slight caveats to that system.

""Jobs"" should not be seen as a resource to try and increase as much as possible. They should be seen as a price we have to pay as a society (i.e. the work needs to be done) for the essential services our society needs. Automation is a good thing, because it reduces the amount of work people need to do to provide these services - robots/ programs are tools, they make jobs easier, just like a screwdriver and nails make it easier to build a desk. One fun thing I like to bring up, is imagine the opposite: let's say in cafes, maybe they should get rid of all of the tables, so that someone could have the job of holding your plates and cups and recieve a wage. If creating ""work"" is something you have to actively try to do in your society, that's another huge flaw!

  
(taking a breather now)

&amp;#x200B;

So I'll try and rein it in now. 

A lot of people are unhappy because it is hard to do absolutely everything I mentioned in that first paragraph. Finding ways to reduce the amount of jobs they have to do to live well would be a good way to fix this. ....Also, a lot of people are doing jobs that are not that useful/ counterproductive to society. If all the people doing these jobs stopped doing those jobs, EVERYONE would be better off - society wouldn't have to put up with whatever negative effect they're having, and they could have an extra 30 hours or so a week to work on living well (exercise, relationships and all that good stuff).   


If I was in power, my plan would be to explore UBI, see if it works, if not, then try to make it work/ figure out other ways of not making it necessary for people to work to live, while still having all of the essential services/ products running. I suppose I would try to ramp up automation as much as possible, and pay essential services a fair wage, and not having enough staff for each service/ industry so that people aren't overworked. UBI has had lots of promising trials, and now in the information era it is easier than ever to automate large numbers of jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna end my ramble here because I have exhausted myself.

If people learn new trades and escape the wage slave grind, good for them!

1) It’s yet another example of the bootstrapping mindset that individualizes social problems. When millions of people are stuck in crappy jobs and living paycheck-to-paycheck, the system is clearly faulty; and no, not everyone can just learn a new skill or trade to escape. People have different talents, temperaments, levels of ambition and drive, and so on. But even if everyone COULD become skilled tradesmen, that brings us to...

2) If everyone became skilled, then highly paid skilled jobs would suddenly become typical working stiff jobs. There’s a reason why techie oligarchs like Mark Zuckerberg want more people learning to code, and it’s not so the average person can enjoy a well-paid tech job. To once again quote Bioshock’s Frank Fontaine, somebody has to scrub the toilets. The simple truth is that there are only so many good jobs to go around. 

Ultimately, in any large society, there will always be a few winners and a lot of losers if the economy is left to its own devices. Therefore, a society should be judged on how well the average person is treated. One shouldn’t need Spartan discipline and special skills to enjoy a decent and dignified life.

Attention: All Younger Generations, your potential was shorted from the start. From basic education to the college degrees that we were talked into based on earning outlooks, we were designed to be milked for our labor potentials and work product to create large amounts of capital for the pre-establish corporate cults. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe we are at the point in the story when we tell the corporations, big tech, the invesment gaming industry, every business that has ever milked its employees for every last ounce of resource in exchange for ""competitive pay"", to go fuck themselves in the deepest pit of dispair that their stubby goblin toes can take them to.

&amp;#x200B;

We are fucking humans first, no matter what, you should be lucky to have a single fucking person willing to drink your corporate koolaid bullshit. They see us as interchangeable and swapable; they see us short term semi recyclable bags of meat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10 years? How would you fit in with our culture? Fuck your curated synthesized cult-sure. They are all never ending rooms, half illuminated by gaudy gas lights. 

&amp;#x200B;

We need to hurt them in ways that are law abiding and honourable or any restructurings are bound to fail.  As the younger generation we need to do as the ants do in the situation of moving relative mountains, with sufficient but short communications, solidarity within set objectives, and awareness of known/potential pathways. 

&amp;#x200B;

We take over parts of the cities that they helped destroy, abandoned and left to rot. We do the work that not one else is willing to do for the sake of human improvement regardless of potential capital loss. Then we take measures for keeping them out when they want to move back in to those areas.Take over the small business shells of all the corporations' victims and turn them into original and unique places. We start our own local businesses with the agenda of running the corporate fucktwats and franchised propaganda out of our cities. They used our generations labor and life potentials to maximize profits and make their investors' nipples jacked to the fucking tits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck all of the major food chains for degrading to this off meta bulk feed diarrhea ridden bullshit that many youth and those lacking formal education are coerced into working in return for capital scraps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck starbucks for charging 6 dollars for a cup or coffee in a plastic cup that will outlive every single millenial barista by a long fucking shot. My favorite add in to my coffee are the unintentional tears of artists pinned down finacially and spritually by the coffee themed propoganda. They cram so many young people within those counter surrounded plateaus of coffee purgatory that it reminds me of petsmart and their overpopulated and under maintenanced 20 gallon tanks of fishy mosh pits. Bro, Its fucking sad. (Mosh pits only sad when you involuntary have to live in one)

&amp;#x200B;

Young people, please take 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, a day and stop thinking about the narratives being generated by fear and greed, the flashy bullshit that the influencers are doing, drama of some pseudo demi god wannabe in hollywood, 

&amp;#x200B;

PAY THE FUCK ATTENTION. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every single corporation in America is fucking hurting right now. We can see this and we can feel this because we are their fucking workforces, their contractors, their front lines, backbones, and in large numbers we are the most vital parts of their designs. We are the ones taking the largest impacts to our physical and metaphysical existences.  They wanted us to be strong enough to not only withstand their abuse, blows to our individuality, but also pamper them with capital in our dazed Stockholm syndrome subrealities. 

&amp;#x200B;

That fatigue, that anger, that stress that keeps you up at night and exhausted in the day, dont overlook that shit, those are the marks made from them taking away who you are and who you could be. They are slashing new scars into us and our personal identities, oh and they are profiting from it. Our pain is feeding their greed; Id happily go hungry if it meant their capital glutony starved to death. They fucking tricked us into cycles or self devaluation and hoped that by the time we caught on to it we'd be too run down to do anything about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

They pumped us full of opiods, stimulants, and anti depressants. We're at a point of pseudo legal marijuana to calm tensions. What the fuck do you think smartphones, media, redundant video game series, comfort low quality food, delivery for fucking everything, and drugs have been deployed in such a way for? To keep us comfortable while our bodies and minds are drained away into the profit margins of some capital entity that probably has contingency plans in the books for employee fatigue related deaths and how to mitigate their liabilities(Bravo WWE, yeah none of those ""contractors"" premature deaths had any thing to do with negligence on your part) 

&amp;#x200B;

Corporate America is falling apart, the decision to collapse the bases of their kingdoms resides in our hands as we are the ones breaking our backs to feed their greed. This shit wont happen overnight, but the deeper our debilitations take us, the more power they gain over us.  We can continue sacraficing the potential for our individuality and self agency to profit the piggy wannabe pseudo pharrohs or we can start the group quest to create the seals of their ending.

&amp;#x200B;

Their business designs are all garbage and ineffcient, we know this because we are forced to work within them and ""make them work"". They care more about stress on profit than stress put on our minds and bodies with their stupid fucking counter productive processes, uniforms, generic awards, and cult level training videos. 

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to continue trying to figure out who I am in the background of my obligations to my employer and my current financial dependency on them.

It's half the pay of my last one, soul-suckingly boring, and the benefits are crap. I took it in the hopes that I could move out of my parents' house after covid, but it doesn't pay enough for rent anywhere around here (and rent is low here). I also took it for the health insurance because I'd be dead without glasses and have some chronic health issues, but it turns out their insurance doesn't cover ANY of my current doctors.

I'm currently annoyed because I cannot find any information online such as how much PTO accrual I get per paycheck, how much PTO I currently have, or even a damn pay stub. All of this is listed in twisty tunnels on their internal website, but you can't access the website unless you're using their internet. Unless I am already at work, I can't find any information at all about my health benefits, PTO, pay, etc. This was a problem a couple of months ago when my first paycheck (direct deposit) was a week late and I couldn't go anywhere online to see if they'd actually sent it or how much it would be. Turns out, I needed to pick up the first check in person, but no one, including in my two day orientation, mentioned it. And I couldn't find that information anywhere online. Even when I can access the stupid internal website, there is no helpful information at all, just a general email address for the benefits department.

Two weeks into my job, I took a couple of days off to go to a wedding and specified that I wanted to take them unpaid - I didn't want to use the meager hours I'd accrued right away, but wanted to save them for when I'd really need them.

All I want is to know if I'll have enough PTO accrued to take a Christmas vacation.

I desperately want to quit this job, but on top of my health issues, my parents are really stressed financially right now and I can't be a financial burden to them. It took me months of job searching to even get this damn job in the first place because there are no opportunities in this tiny town.

First off, x and x just want to make the best decision and have open and honest communication before they rush into making business decisions.
X and x are millennials who have triggers that cause them to second guess every decision because they have been judged in the workforce for not being efficient. They have racing thoughts and truly want to help but it seems like the more they help, the more they are stripped of their personal pleasures. Once someone starts to help too much, other people will stop helping themselves and just rely on the brave helper.
That is where I am stuck. We herald helping people and it is seen as a moral obligation. But yet, so many of us millennials are under the sad impression that we will live fast and die young, and some actually are ready to do that. That was borderline a joke in the 1950's, just a slang for young people. I think a different approach will help the young out of the slum. No new committee or program is going to get us out of this. Although we still think we're going to have shitty, short lives, we do everything we can to extend our lives. We have enormous safety measures with a lack of common sense. So yeah, we will die young but not because we chose to. And those who make it to 40 will have a great time saving money for retirement, let me tell ya! I believe millennials and generations closely surrounding have a choice to make. Is it time to take risks and release ourselves from the grip of the tightened capitalist (who many of us are turning into), or, in other words, to do this: create a society where nothing is a problem until it is a problem.
Not making millions of packages of potatoes to have half of them rot because people didn't need them. Not needing everything right away and championing service, when servicers are stretched too thin. Being more personally autonomous and using the wonderful gift of youtube to fix things, connect things, build things, compare and contrast things. Just get smarter. This relates to my previous point of not relying so much on the helper.
Then some will say, what if I'm not interested and I want to pay someone to do this service for me?
To that I say, good for you that you were fortunate enough to have enough money to pay someone to do that. But being insufficient in funds is enough to give me interest in learning how to be self-sufficient.

While security has its own dynamics - it’s expected to be a 24/7 operation in order to save clients money on building insurance - people who work in fast food, retail, hospitals, and so on also know too well what it’s like having their days off ruined because of understaffing.

The other part of my job, is where we advise businesses on how to recruit - we look over job postings, explain labor market info and where to post jobs, etc.

Well, today we had a statewide meeting to discuss the ""labor shortage"" where an economist presented his findings that something like %95 of people who are not in the labor supply, meaning they ""could"" be working but aren't, are retired, students, injured/sick/disabled, or have family obligations. The other %5 were ""other,"" meaning if you stretched, you might assume those %5 had 'no reason' to be unemployed.

We discussed ideas and strategies that we could give to fast food joints and retailers on how they can target the %95 to go back to work for them.

Like, god forbid retirees enjoy the fruits of their years of labor, people spend time focusing on investing in themselves, take time off to recover from or take care of family with injuries or sickness during a worldwide pandemic! 

NO!!! Our economic system DEMANDS their sweat! We need to get their lazy asses back on the floor! Instead of spending our time advising workers on how to pursue their dreams, let's help businesses exploit HARDER!

But many of those same coworkers, when exposed to data that shows these places don't pay living wages, reply ""WHAT?? These no skill BURGER Flippers don't deserve $15/hr!!"" And that's pretty much a direct quote...

The new position pays more, allows me to work from home, and holds the promise of personal and professional growth far beyond what I could have ever achieved at my current job, so needless to say, I'm stoked.

Against my better judgement, I put in 2 weeks notice at my current job (week and a half, actually) so I'm just lingering here, playing out the string. I am honestly enjoying this lame duck period, knowing that nobody expects anything from me. As they are wont to do, my shitty employer still found a way to piss me off today, though.

Just a little backstory: The CEO of my company makes upwards of $6 million per year. Last year, during the peak of the 'Rona, they denied my team our annual merit raises, suspended the company 401(k) match, and took away my team's budget for occasional meals, supplies, etc. We were unapologetically stranded onsite while most everyone else was able to work from home. Then, miraculously, the company sent out their annual EOY financial disclosures - RECORD PROFITS!!! Yay for us! Bonuses for all the executives! Seriously, fuck these people.

On to today's slap in the face, though: I have 56 hours of PTO in my bank that I accrued during the first 8 months of the year. I asked HR to confirm whether I would be paid out that remaining balance on my last check, considering I earned that time and it belongs to me. The answer was a resounding NO. Arizona state law doesn't consider unused PTO as wages like other states, but individual employers are free to set their own policy. Of course, my greedy, shitty employer is going to force me to forfeit 56 hours of earned PTO, because reasons. Adding to that, I am not allowed to use vacation hours during my ""notice period"", and would not be paid for them if I tried. 

So, I told off the HR bitch, 'cause fuck her, that's why! I also intend to use a couple sick days between now and the end of next week, because I have those hours in my bank and sick time *is* protected by AZ state law. Still, there goes more than $1500 worth of earned vacation/holiday time into the void. If they insist on taking their pound of flesh, I'm not going to do jack shit for the remainder of my time here. Worst. Company. Ever.

TL;DR - Got a new job, put in my 2 weeks, current employer is going to screw me out of my earned vacation time, even though the CEO makes $6 million per year and they reported record profits, because reasons.",So glad I'm leaving (rant),13

I’ve worked in warehouses and fast food and cleaned toilets and shoveled manure. I’ve cried in so many office closets and walk in freezers. Hell, I cried just this morning.

I’ve struggled with mental illness (anxiety, OCD, severe depression) my whole life which is why I put up with a lot of abuse at work in the past- I felt like I didn’t have a choice if I wanted to keep my jobs, and my parents said I could not live with them as an adult. I also needed the money for therapy and medication - but my symptoms were also exacerbated by my jobs.

I was never paid well for any of these jobs and I don’t have hardly anything to show for my hard work and I’ve been working since I was 16. All I have are bad memories.

In my current job which I took out of dire necessity I’ve been bullied a bit and have a micromanaging team leader. I work under and report to 4 separate people and field questions from strangers all week. I am an introvert. I hate the work and find both boring and stressful. Spending 8 hours every day doing it hurts me deeply.

My partner on the other hand never had to do physical labor jobs and was never bullied at work. In fact, he gets away with being kind of a jerk at times. (I am always super friendly and accommodating to people. Probably a defense mechanism.) He had never had to skip meals or worry about health insurance. He likes his job and makes 6 figures, and good for him. 

However he just does not seem to understand how much my job has a negative effect on my life. He is always relaxed and doesn’t worry about money. I worry all the time about money and … everything. He wonders why I don’t just take hours off to do laundry or play video games like he does. (We are monitored via work chat). I feel like we are in two separate worlds. 

I am just not sure what to do anymore because I can’t imagine working for the rest of my life. Nobody ever listens to me when I tell them how bad it is.

About an hour later, he starts to feel sick, feverish and nauseous. He texts his manager to let her know what’s up. She tells him to “just sit down.” He does, but it’s getting worse. He texts her again and she tells him he “can’t just send yourself home” and there’s no one else to cover. 

He texts us, his parents, and we tell him “do what you gotta do” so he walks out. 

I know he didn’t have COVID or the norovirus or anything contagious—it was a reaction to getting the meningitis vaccine the day before. His manager sure didn’t know that, so not only was she willing to make my son work while he was sick, she was willing to risk him infecting his co-worker and customers. (Enjoy that sub!)

On top of all that, it turns out he was never getting his legally-required breaks, since he was often alone in the shop or, when he was working with someone else, they were “too busy.”

So if there's a hole in the schedule for any reason, somebody on shift is forced to work another shift up to 16 total hours. I understood going in that this would occasionally happen. If someone calls in an hour before their shift, and you can't find someone willing to work it, it is what it is. But the agency's personnel department has never been competent at adequately staffing the agency. In ten years I've worked for it I've seen locations where everybody gets mandated every day and I've seen vacant positions go unfilled for years. The pandemic has made the already bad staffing issues much worse and I've been working multiple non-consensual double shifts per week for over a year and a half. They're required to give 8 hours off between shifts. I have an hour commute so for me, this 8 hours is six hours. Then I have to do personal things like shower and eat when get I get home and give myself an hour before I leave for work to get ready. So this six hours turns into a maximum of four hours of sleep in-between 16 hour non-consensual shifts. This is not sustainable and I see now that the agency will not ever get it's shit together and this situation will not get any better so I've been calling in after I get mandated and refusing and doing precursory searches for what other jobs are out there. Some of the the agency's actions have been and continue to be unethical and abusive. There had been a policy that mandation was a last resort, only to be done when there was no other possible way to meet the staffing minimums. But last year they instituted a new policy that part time employees would be mandated before full time workers could volunteer to pick up a shift to save the state some money on overtime. I didn't even think this was legal. I checked with the union and they said it was. It's highly unethical to put money before consent and I think whoever thought of this policy belongs in jail, morally if they're not technically breaking any laws. They've counterproductively instituted hiring freezes, and they're supposed to get someone to relieve you if you're facing a fourth consecutive non-consensual double shift but my boss's boss had made it clear verbally in writing that they don't have to. I've made it clear to my immediate supervisors that I don't give a fuck and I'll call in when I need to and I'm done sacrificing my wellness because of the agency's lack of competence or ethics and I don't care if I get fired.  I'm going to a doctor later today to try to get a note that says I need reasonable accomodations and can't work like that.

Sorry for the long rant. Mostly why I'm posting is for some advice about my future being uncertain. The most responsible thing to do would probably be to line up another job, then quit my current one. But I'm wondering if getting fired, getting unemployment for a while, then getting a new job would be a good move. Do I still need to be fired to collect unemployment? When I looked into it 20 years ago, a person was not eligible for any benefits if they'd voluntarily left their last job. Should I worry about the reference? I know there is very limited information a former employer can give and they probably do only confirm employment dates but I'm a little worried they'd say I was terminated and not rehireable and this job is ten years of work experience for me so I don't want to burn the reference.

I'm studying engineering in polytechnic, currently in an internship semester, where students have a choice to go source for a company and get $800 a month or stay in-house working on a project of our choosing for zero dollars. Working hours for both are 0800 to 1730 on weekdays for 22 weeks. 

$800 might as well be nothing, plus the school grades your impact/outcome based on your contributions in your internship period. Seeing as a random company aren't guaranteed to have meaningful projects to work on (students usually end up at start-ups, and we know how well those go) so I opted for the in-house option. 

This probably was the right decision in hindsight, my friend went with an outside company and they got him doing menial tasks and fixing xerox printers. In 2021. What's he gonna write in his report..?

Anyway, the project I was assigned to was hella unorganised, the previous batch of student interns were trusted to document their progress and come up with manuals on how to operate the machines, areas of improvement, etc. And the current batch was just given a crash course by the former interns (the ones who showed up anyway) and left there with no supervision. The project supervisors are often doing lectures or whatever it is they're so busy with and only visit for 10 minutes maybe once a week. 

Ok. My school's pretty big on the whole ""self-learning"" thing so I guess we'll just pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and whatnot. We dealt with automation, my station had conveyors, assembly lines, and robot arms, I learnt what I could, programmed the PLC, robot control, though the real engineers would come in if I ran into something I couldn't do. 

But there wasn't always something to do, I'm pretty confident with PLC programming and could eventually finish most tasks quickly. Then it's counting hours for the day, at one point, the 20 year-old pneumatic compressor supplying air to my station broke and I was left with even less to fill my time. I had the longest days of my life during this semester. 

Fast-forward multiple weeks and a merciful (for us) lockdown caused by Covid spikes, and I'm in my last week of internship, they fixed the compressor, I finished my work, my station is fully autonomous, reports and documentation done. I did everything I needed to ahead of schedule. 

My batch must've been hardworking because the director decided he wanted to meet all the in-house interns across all projects, he said his thanks and whatever, ""We hope you will continue your learning journey and come back to work on your respective projects. Projects are never done"", ""To show our appreciation, we'll be providing free lunch for today"", yada yada yada. 

Through the session, I was left wondering what a school director's does for their job, that they could take the time to do this, I could be watching anime in my lab. It was my last day anyway, but wait, there's more. 

The director and management board decided they wanted to see our group's project in-person, out of all the others. And they would greatly appreciate if we could come back next week for a demo (I doubt they'll be providing free lunch this time). 

I feel like they don't respect the students' time, we were forced to skip our holidays and work for you, without pay, while other students were on holiday, we were coming back 0800 to 1730. And now on our last day, you want us to come back and personally show you our work? Couldn't have read our reports, watched the videos that showed the operation processes, anything besides stealing more of our off-time? 

This just reeks of shit, I had to quit my part-time video-editing job to for this internship, I had to solve every problem that arose myself. 22 weeks for a $6 lunch set, like paying your interns isn't a sign of appreciation. 

The other interns in my project group didn't seem affected, but they defo should be. Fuck the director and his nothing job, the management board can manage deez nuts.

The reason I went into teaching was for the students and to try to make a meaningful impact on the world.

Nevertheless, we should not have to “volunteer” our time to help administration plan events or attend “voluntary” conferences for school/district wide initiatives without proper compensation. 

Teachers are already under appreciated and underpaid enough as it is. However, districts and administrations are ALWAYS asking teachers to do more and to help them. The biggest issue I have in saying “no” is that they always send the message:

 “WeLl WhAt AbOuT tHe StUdEnTs?”
“ It WiLl HeLp OuR cOmMuNiTy AnD sChOoL cUlTuRe”

This is TOXIC and it needs to change! It discounts all the hard work and effort when teachers already “volunteer” so much of their time outside of school and our contracted hours.

So I used to work for a very successful, large, and high volume veterinary clinic that was owned by a family. I started in the kennel at a generous $11/hr (pretty high starting pay for the job in my area) and after about 7 months I was offered to train as a veterinary technician. So going from walking dogs and scooping poop to assisting in surgery, managing hospital cases, handling controlled drugs etc. I was not offered a raise when I completed the training time, but since I had only been there less than a year I didn’t think too much about it.  Years go by and I excelled at the job by quite a bit (to toot my own horn a tad).  Most of the doctors by this point came to rely on me heavily every shift. I became slightly irked at my lack of a raise through the entire time. One day I decided I was going to reach out to the owner and ask for a raise. I was told I needed to wait for our next reviews. I was fairly irritated at this point as I had 5 years of fantastic reviews, but didn’t push it too hard. After a series of events that had me working 16+ hours a day for 9 days in a row for a few weeks I decided to push the subject again. It was obvious the owner was irritated at this, but given the circumstances (we had become severely understaffed suddenly) and the fact my technician manager and every other doctor (including the owners son and daughter) backed me up he yielded and I was bumped up to $15/hr. Roughly 2 months later I was 4 hours late to a shift due to driving my wife, at the time, to a psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt. Everyone was super understanding and nice. 2 weeks later I get my paycheck and it’s substantially lower than expected and I realized I was paid minimum wage with no warning or anything. I emailed the owner after days of failing to get him on the phone asking why and he responded, while cc’ing every doctor and manager at the practice, that my tardiness and “lack of focus” was the reason for my pay cut for that pay period. Every single person included in that email disagreed with him. After a few conversations with him I told him I would not be continuing my employment there after my already established schedule, to which he responded “tOo lAtE ur aLreaDy fIRed”. I was pissed at his lack of appreciation for me busting my ass for 5 years for him at the time, but as time has gone by I find myself more and more pissed at the sudden, no warning pay cut as a punishment and that I was conditioned so well to not even question the legality of the move.  Was that even legal? 

I now work remotely in a job I barely ever even talk to my manager and thinking back on what all happened at the clinic just puts a sour taste in my mouth for most employment options where I have to deal with power horny owners who get a kick out of flexing their superiority against the hired peons.

Now, it goes without saying that there are variations to this topic; work can be many things, and what we do to make money is entirely relative. Each person has distinguished paths that determine how much they enjoy their job, how much they have to “work”, how well they are compensated, etc., etc. But this all goes without saying. A large portion of “work” that humans do is not just a simple job, a trivial, productive task we perform in order to contribute to society. We do things at our jobs that we would normally never do. I would never, and I mean never, vouch for a large corporation the way I do at my job. I would never, and I mean never, spend 40 hours a week in a dimly lit building surrounded by mass produced products created through slave labor. These character-breaking actions, of which there are many more than previously listed, belittle my spirit; to provide evidence of this would be pointless, because it is purely anecdotal. Except, it’s not. My feelings of hopelessness as a result of my “work” is shared by millions throughout the world; Mental Health America, a non-profit devoted to mental health issues in America, has quantified such evidence, determining that my workplace industry (retail) is one of the three workplace industries that score in the bottom 10% of occupations, alongside manufacturing and food and beverage (Cheang 1). Minimizing “work” by expressing a sentiment akin to “it’s just a job” completely degrades the millions of individuals that are being stripped of their humanity every day as a result of forced labor, that pushes said individuals to the point of mental and / or physical exhaustion.

The side effects of these jobs are overwhelming, with over 50% of employees in these workplace industries feeling unappreciated and looking for new jobs on a consistent basis (Cheang 1). These numbers have surely risen since the COVID-19 pandemic, with one study conducted in Arizona stating that of the 3,996 grocery union members who answered the questionnaire, “sixty percent of workers surveyed reported feeling above-average levels of stress. Thirty-seven percent reported feeling moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression (Hernandez 1)”. I could cite specific sources indulging us as to the reasons why these mental health issues have worsened, but I feel that to be unnecessary. Instead, recall an instance when you were browsing the shelves of a grocery store during the first six months of the pandemic. Recall the customers walking around without masks, grabbing things off of shelves carelessly and placing them in incorrect locations, and remember the instances when these individuals would communicate maskless to employees wearing their required PPE. Could you possibly imagine the sheer anxiety the employee would experience in such an absurd situation? A situation where a customer is putting the employee’s life at risk for reasons of stupidity, laziness, ideological maliciousness, or all of the above? Could you imagine the loss of faith, the adrenaline, the fatigue that would follow such an experience?

I could spend the next hour working on citing this little essay I’ve typed out. But honestly, I have nothing further to articulate in regards to quantitive evidence. The exploitation that service workers suspected was occurring for decades has since come to fruition; not only were we left on the frontlines of a life threatening virus unqualified and unprepared, but we were compensated monetarily the exact same as we were previous to these newfound obstacles. We never received more than a few scraps of our fair share of the profits. While every imperishable food and roll of toilet paper were selling in record high volumes for record high profits, we didn’t see more than a few hundred dollars in “thank you pay”. When we voiced our concerns regarding our own personal safety and the safety of those we love, we were told not to engage with the customers who would risk our lives for their laziness because “escalating conflict is never a good idea”. These fucking cowards that we call “management” bent their knee to the shareholders who wanted nothing more than to capitalize on panic buying, leaving us, the bottom of the barrel, the servants, the service workers, to deal with hoards of potential walking death sentences and the increased labor that coincided with the multiplied traffic.

And now, our “management” expects us to return to an era when our naivety was fruitful and easy, when we would allow customers to disrespect us to our faces because “work is work”. Never mind the psychological scars that occurred as a result of their greed. Never mind our still-thin bank accounts and directionless free time. Never mind our sustained exposure to the worst impulses that our consumeristic society has to offer, leaving us unable to look people in the eye due to distrust and disillusionment. “Work”, at least to those average enough to maintain a consistent employment status with a large-scale department store, is a malformed and dismembered existence that we are required to physically and mentally engage with for a third of our waking lives. “Work” is indentured servitude with a few amenities, amenities that do not compensate for the absolute discomfort that we are put subjected to for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.

You may say “There are people in this world that cannot eat, sleep in dirt, and are slaves in the literal sense of the word. Your life could be much worse than it presently is”. To this, I would respond: do you think so lowly of the human race that you truly believe this is the best we have to offer?","A rant, and an essay.",6

&amp;nbsp;

Woke up feeling particularly gloomy thinking about the prospect of a better life -- mine's really not bad relative to others -- and it just blows me away that nothing has really indicated that anything is going to change any time soon.


I'll admit I haven't done a ton a of research on the topic, so I have no idea what industries would be best, which geographical locations, etc., but it's not hard to see that any significant loss in just one area would cripple many others via the ""butterfly effect"". We've seen real world examples in a very short term here with Covid-19, followed by the environmental disasters in and around Texas. I have to imagine that entire industries were barely hanging on by a thread, made apparent by the supply shortages that can't even be properly forecasted to this day. The astonishing part is that, while these natural disasters definitely could have been planned and prepared for much better (quality infrastructure, more social safety nets), at the end of the day they were sorta out of our control. If there was a concerted effort put together, a general strike, the effects and duration would be placed directly in the hands of the people, it could literally halt everything until demands were met. I've seen loose theories that just 30-40% of the work force ceasing operations (general strike) would be sufficient enough to make a HUGE and detrimental negative impact on the economy overall, which would be GOOD for us in the long run.


I'm fully aware that there are would be a huge variance on impacts on the people during this period, some are in much worse positions as others, and it would absolutely be scary. Organized mutual aid would be put to it's test here, and like I said I'm nowhere near having complete logistics figured out.


Another thing that would need to be considered is ensuring that everybody held strong and resilient throughout the designated time. At some point after things really kicked off, leadership could be inherited by trustworthy, non-profit driven organizations. IWW (and other respectable unions) could take the brunt of this, and other closely scrutinized grass roots political groups could fill in as needed; again logistics required, I'm just a simple stupid worker.

&amp;nbsp;

As I said before, it astonishes me that overall sentiment hasn't really changed, especially in regards to recent events over the past couple years. Sure there are loads of people posting online, *cough cough*, but on a real world day-to-day basis I feel like everyone I come across is either happy that things are ""returning to normal"" (they're not, and ""normal"" was, at best, not great for the common populace), or waiting for things to ""return to normal"". What is it going to take for Americans to realize how fucked things are? Covid, natural disasters destroying necessary infrastructure, clear and evident tampering of the market (more clear and evident than before), what looks like another housing bubble coming up, people being booted from their homes during the pandemic, new record temperatures every year, the list goes on and on just for recent things. I hate to be a doomer, but it feels like we're all going to be burnt up or some of us will be living in Mad Max world before a significant amount of people realize that change is necessary, even though we're already way past that point. The entire world is greatly suffering and I'm constantly filled with dread.",It's insane that so much could be changed in the matter of a few weeks but at this rate I doubt anything will ever happen - [Longish Rant],5

Work sucks ASS, that's the general cencus, but people still do it obviously. I don't understand how that's even possible, if I'm working more than 20/25 hours a week it's as if my entire being shuts down and I am only work. Before work I dread it, at work I dread it, I come home and dread it, on my days off I dread it, there's never a time I'm home from work. I even DREAM about working, I cannot escape it. I've had 4-5 jobs throughout my life and no matter how much I like the job itself or the people/management, I still feel like I'm dying. So much so that I just fantasize about ways to kms or get fired just so I don't have to work (not suicidal but damn if it don't sound like a peaceful option). So I've started this new job, 4 shifts in, and once again I feel like I'm dying. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I struggle to shower, I have no physical or mental energy to enjoy my time out of work, and even weed doesn't help me handle these feelings. I'm on stimulants and an snri and have been for a while, they work wonders and for the first time in my life I feel happy and capable and creative. But four days in and all of that has changed, I'm short tempered, I spiral easier and deeper, I can't handle any extra stress outside of work and I am always pissed off at the people I love. FOUR DAYS AND MY LIFE IS IN RUINS AGAIN. this isn't a coincidence, it's happened with every job I've had, and I've had to leave every job I had mainly due to mental health. It doesn't get better with age it gets worse.

So as far as solutions go, I'm moving down to PT instead of 40 hrs a week, and I guess I need to fix the root issue, why do I feel this way. It's because I lack motivation entirely. The idea of a great future without money issues and the opportunity to live a full life and such is not motivation enough to feel this bad everyday. Nothing is motivation enough. It hurts to much and takes to much out of me for any justification to motivate me through it. As everyone in this thread believes, the system is janked.

To survive in a life you didn't choose to be in you have to pay money, to pay money you have to work. To get a job you enjoy or a career you have to go to school, which you have to pay for, so you have to get a job. I'm in Canada, and nowadays it's a struggle to pay rent and bills and feed yourself off a FT entry level job, but I can't get any other jobs because I don't have experience, but to get experience I either need to get the job or go to school. Interviews are a facade on both sides, you go to work at the time your told, do menial tasks and even when you want to go above and beyond you're not allowed to. If there's an idiotic problem at work because of dumb rules and you think of a solution it's shut down. If there's a part of your job you do find passion for, you can't explore it because it's further than your job scope. You are allowed to be ill only a certain amount of days and you have to get permission to do anything outside of work, you're an owned slave to someone and your life is no longer your own.

This whole problem I believe could be solved or atleast helped if I could get a job that sparks a little passion, I do not come by passion often, most times at all, so combine no passion with no motivation and a lot of mental struggle and you get someone who can't handle work. What could I find passion in? Anything to do with pets, or kids, something that means I can look forward to something in my day.

I can't help it. I used to think it happened because of my adhd tendencies, but this week I realised it's because I absolutely hate working. I hate the feeling of my energy and time being exploited for someone else to get rich. I hate the fact that I feel that most of the world's problems could be solved by doing away with our dehumanising capitalistic system.

I'm in consumer charity fundraising for christ sake. A job which I think is very noble as we really make a difference for a few amazing charities (among which Plan International, check them out as they do amazing work). But still I feel that in my ideal world we wouldn't need charities because in my ideal world, the world would be a more fair and more human place.

I hop jobs. I like meeting new people and learning stuff. Then, when the dust has settled, it's work again and then I go back to the aforementioned stuff: I'm contributing to a system that so goes against all of my values that I get down and a bit resentful in EVERY job. No matter how great the job is.

This is mostly just a rant, but if anyone has any tips on how to reconcile the inescapable fact that I have to participate in this system in order to have food and shelter - please do share.

Let me clarify further. Creative fields at one time we're literally just like any other trade. Sculpting, painting and so on. These fields required a shit ton of hard work, study and practice outside the workday to get good at. And these people were paid well.

But Creative work today? Fuck that. After decades of ""everyone is an artist"" bullshit. That entire field has been ran into the ground.

Look up Graphic Designer on indeed or LinkedIn.
Look up the stats of the amount of time art students in college spend outside of class studying. ( Just as much if not more than lawyers).

The creative field or creative tech has become undeniably unstable.

Entry level jobs.
3-5 years experience.
BA Degree.
$12-$15/hr 
Long list of responsibilities that are literally other fields and require multiple roles.



If you could understand the amount of work it takes to build a Good portfolio. Having to spend ungodly amounts of time keeping up with new software, new trends, psychology, communication and marketing. On top of having to have a social media presence. It's mind boggling stupid.

And this isn't even mentioning how much money software and training is going to constantly cost you. I must've invested in literally 30+ programs by now that all cost me atlease $200-$1500.

Want to talk work life balance? Imagine having to spend 40+ hours a week outside of work keeping up and improving your skills? All unpaid.

Job interviews? Imagine while working full-time for shit wages, having to constantly do ""art test"" for companies. 3d artist taking 2-4 weeks on these test just to be rejected for a job paying sub $30k.

The best thing you can do is to take your skills and work for yourself. Create a product in china, sell it retail in the USA.

I've worked countless jobs that if I was paid 5-10% off of my work commission wise would've increased my pay $100k a year. Looking back I could've made millions off of my labor. Vs being paid shit while others who do nothing profit.

There is a reason why almost all designers don't last in the field past 50. The pay is awful. Jobs are unstable as fuck. They either jump to code, or are lucky to land a director spot paying $50k+ a year.
$50-60k for a job after 20 years is pathetic.

It's almost like all the BS middle management made up jobs pay stupid high wages, while all the jobs that require the actual skills and labor pay shit.

Long story short I have to live on my own, parents aren't okay with my sexuality so moving in with family isn't an option.

The area my SO works is more urban (expensive) and would really cause a financial strain.

That's child abuse, right? And we *are* only mother nature’s children, after all.

As a species, we need not pretend food is limited, or unavailable to everyone. If it makes you upset that people “work so hard” to bring the food to the people (and ""of COURSE they must be paid for doing such work!"") , I urge you to reconsider where humans got food from to begin with. We found it in the wild, where it grew from dirt and water, with the sun as the only source of energy.

I know you can say ""just grow your own garden then!"", but you're missing the point. Every plot of land is owned by somebody else in America, and we don't all have fancy plots of land that can truly support us. Some of us live in Alaska or Canada or somewhere we cannot grow our own food year round in which we did not choose to be born. This is a large problem, not just something to laugh at and say ""grow your own shit, lazy ass!”. This is my entire life view and I take it seriously. It is ILLEGAL to tend to a garden on someone else's property without their permission. They are owned by, that's right, the rich, or well off.

&amp; Yes, the wild ALSO is where we have the biggest a chance of dying, I KNOW. I just find it weird how animals are given feed in shelters—in slaughterhouses even—, prisoners are fed meals in jail, but humans are fed corporate shit lifestyle lies that tell them that if they don’t “function“ in their vision of society, they don’t deserve to live? Go live in the woods?

But in *modern* society, we have NO chance of dying from predation (this is the whole purpose of the society, actually!)

But that does NOT MEAN food should be given to the rich more easily. That defeats the purpose of the society, and only benefits the upper class, who are all fundamentally wrong for so much as BEING so rich, as they are inevitably hoarding food in *real time*. **This is TRUE, as poverty is the leading cause of starvation worldwide. (**[**https://www.bread.org/what-causes-hunger#:\~:text=Poverty%20is%20the%20main%20cause,%241.90%20per%20day%20or%20less**](https://www.bread.org/what-causes-hunger#:~:text=Poverty%20is%20the%20main%20cause,%241.90%20per%20day%20or%20less)**.)**

It means the rich need to realize that the very essence of the word “rich” is negative and selfish when you aren’t also helping the poor by distributing your excess money almost immediately. This should really start to resonate with more Americans, as we are one of the most disgustingly spoiled countries on the planet. On top of that, since we live in our own little bubble here in America, and pretend the rest of the dying planet doesn't exist, why not fix things here anyway? Do you know how easy it would be? Tell the rich they are going to be imprisoned if they don't distribute. Is that wrong? ABSOLUTELY not, in my eyes. We're already neglecting the rest of the world. Start SOMEWHERE for Christ's sake.

It does not make you a good person to hoard your money; even if you think things like “if I spend it, who knows where it will go?”. You most likely know where it goes. Don’t kid yourself, do your research. Support just causes and stop purchasing things that are wholly unneeded by our species. Please stop to think about how worthless your purchases are compared to the people who have nothing: 10% of humans on our beautiful planet.",(Rant) Food not being a fundamental human right is purposeful abuse on the human race caused by the rich.,57

&amp;#x200B;

As of today, i'm 25 and on peak financially and physically. I'm working as a sales executive in the N1 company (in our field) in my country.

Thing is, i'm bored af, i started here 1.5 years ago as a warehouse employee replacing a sick worker that was not meant to come back ever.(He miraculously survived his ultra heavy alcool and cocaine problem and came back like he never left). So there's 1 dude too much in the company (me) and i get offered a chance to become an developer and they give me access to web lessons to learn SQL.(they also tell me it better works out or i'm out)

The thing is, i hate studying, i hate ""working"" at home, unless i have a super interesting thing to do and i'm 200% in or it is a physical job and it occupies my mind. But telling me to come everyday, do the physical work and when i get home after a 8hr day + 1h commute to learn something people go to university during 3 years killed my morale. Also, they gave me 1 year to be work ready and it was that or i was out. Morale -&gt; 0

Time goes on, i try hard to study (fucking up my personnal time and relationships) and the colleague who's the senior dev and who's supposed to be training me is never at the office so no one to show me the work.

4 months in, they call me for a meeting, saying i did 0 efforts to make it work and that i'm like 0.1mm from being fired. I had to take some naps during my lunch time wich all my colleagues in the warehouse were ok with, and i almost got fired because i was sleeping during my un-paid lunchtime.(Some people are taking naps for more than their lunchtime and no one bats an eye)

They also tell me that they can't fire the alcoolic (or ex-alcoolic we don't really know tbh)  because that would be un-ethic. And they gave credit to someonelse for 2 weeks where i managed the warehouse alone ( we were 3 ) when covid started.

BUT!! AS GOOD LORDS AS THEY ARE - they found a solution , make me a sales executive so they can look like super cool people ""saving"" me from unemployement. It was all cool when starting because i learned new stuff etc. Now it's just boredom, i'm a secretary disguised as a sales exec, sending emails like a robot. Thank god reddit is there and now i found my place in this sub.

I'm not 100% against working, but i'm 100% to let people choose how they spend their short time on this planet, i'm all in on investments and cryptos to hopefully retire at 35-40 wich is my life goal at the moment.

I'm lucky to have a passion in videogames and IT stuff in general to withstand working in that field, but my income is reinvested, in the hope of making enough cash to not fucking care anymore.

Also weed / cat / GF / videosgames are litteraly saving me from depression and full speeding straight into a wall on the highway.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep strong out there folks, and also basic income for every human being when?

I know what I did was dangerous and stupid and I know that I'm a dumbass, but that's what the system, being one that doesn't cater well to people with anxiety, has lead me to.

I woke up this morning and immediately felt anxiety. Today was not the day, I didn't want to go to work at all. I work as a pharmacy tech and honestly hate the job so much. I have had so many negative experiences with customers at every job since I was 18 that I can't hardly stand it anymore. I feel traumatized and scared all the time, ontop of my anxiety that makes it much worse. Ontop of that, everyone there makes me feel dumb. I'm the new guy and know nothing about medicine. I feel out of place between the pharmacists, pharmacy students, and others going to school for something medical related. Then you have me, just some degen who likes weed and video games. I always worry that people and customers are judging me because I feel like I don't know jack shit there. I don't even know why I applied now that I'm thinking about it.

But you know what I find scarier? Not having a job, losing my apartment and my fiance hating me for being useless. So naturally I was terrified to call out. I've already called out twice in the past month. Calling out is such a terrifying task for me as well.

So, my mind says ""Why not be sick?"". After a little bit of research, I find out that drinking warm salt water can make you throw up. Now, I'm not a complete idiot, but I am pretty dumb. I know people aren't really supposed to drink salt water. But I hate being at work so much that I was prepared to endure whatever. So I drank some salt water, a big hefty glass, didn't even measure the salt. 

My plan was in place, I'd walk into work, the salt water would do its thing, I'd make a spectacle of it and puke infront of someone and be sent home. I'd grab some water or something with electrolytes and be on my merry way. It did not go that way at all. I felt dehydration hit, I got hot, felt like I was sweating. My stomach begins to gurgle and my vision is kind of foggy. I feel confusion hit me, but I try to push through hoping I'll blow chunks soon enough. I just occasionally dry heaved and kept working in that state for about 4 hours before actually being sent home after ran off to the bathroom to have a full on panic attack. I looked in the mirror and noticed my face was bright red too. How did nobody notice sooner that something was wrong. 

This system is so cruel and I feel trapped, feel like I'm stuck in customer service jobs, forever to be miserable. The only thing that ever seems to make me happy is my twitch streaming and gaming. But let's be honest, I will never make it as a streamer. The odds are against me on that. 


Anyway, that's my story/rant about how I nearly overdosed on sodium today and felt like I was dying of dehydration all because I didn't want to be uncomfortable for 8 hours today because I wasn't in the right headspace to deal with people. Either that or maybe I was just too weak minded to call out. You decide.","I nearly poisoned myself just so I could avoid work today, a rant.",13

I work roughly 10 hours a day, on my feet the entire time, from 8am to 6:30pm or whenever work is done (the latest I ever worked was 9pm). I purposefully picked this schedule so I could have more than a measly 2 days off; my husband works 3rd shift (hustling for that overnight differential) so the weekend is really the only time we get to see each other for more than a couple hours per day.


Every night is the same thing. He leaves for work, and no matter whether I try to relax or actually be productive I just cannot get to sleep. There's always one more thing I want to do, one more video I want to watch, one more distraction. Sometimes I'm just not tired. Next thing I know, it's after midnight, and when I wake up in the morning I feel like shit. It's even spilling into my weekends which wouldn't be too big of a deal except that I either wake up early anyway and feel awful, or I sleep so fucking late that I miss out on actually enjoying the time away from work. I'm breaking out, my appetite is all over the place, last night I got about 5 hours of sleep and had so much caffeine this morning that hours later, my left eye is twitching. And I know I should go to bed at a decent time tonight but I have shit to do! Or sometimes it'll take me months to do something because I feel like I don't have enough time to get it done so I never start!


I want out. My husband supports this idea as long as I'm doing something productive with my time and trying to make a little money but as someone who drank the Kool -aid for such a long time, the idea of working part time or on my own and bringing in less money than I make now straight-up gives me anxiety and so much guilt. We're also trying to start a family (I'm 35 and he's 37 so we're running out of time) so I'm even more terrified of the idea of us not having enough money.


I know I need therapy and have been trying to get started with it for months but keep running into issues. In the meantime though I'm slowly killing myself (really smart when you're trying to conceive /s) with stress and anxiety and guilt and sleep deprivation. I want to make a change but after working so hard for so long to get where we are now, I'm terrified of losing it. I don't know what to do.

He seems to have some of the ideas for antiwork down, like ""laziness is good"". On the other hand, he makes comments such as ""Since you don't have a job, you're not doing anything important"". Because of course, what I want to spend time on doesn't matter. He claims to have good empathy, but then repeatedly proves he doesn't. Or does, and just doesn't use it, which is worse.

This thinking appears to be rooted in me still living with him, and ""You're not paying enough in rent to cover what you use"", so he thinks he's entitled to my time, simply because I'm not spending it elsewhere. If I'm working, he leaves me alone.

I'd love to just tell him to fuck off with his entitled shit, but again, I still live with him, and right now, it's easier to just go along with it than to try to argue with his arrogant attitude.

Sadly, in the current age - food and shelter access is only granted through the obtainment of an arbitrary made up fiction called: 'money'.

Money - which has only been in existence for 3 thousand years while the human species has existed for around 300,000 years - and yet the majority have come to view money as some fundamental intrinsic and inescapable aspect of human life, despite it's presence in human life only making up around 1 percent of our time as humans and the fact that it is ultimately an arbitrary man made invention. Furthermore most people view it as sane and acceptable despite the fact that 8 individual men have as much monetary wealth as half the earths human population combined, 25.000 human beings starve to death unnecessarily every single day on this planet not due to any tangible shortages of food or recourses but merely due to a lack of purchasing power which is an unreal made up concept, a famous TV star 'earns' more money in a couple of days of filming a frivolous TV show episode than a full time firefighter 'earns' in over 40 years of life risking service. So because of our economy and thus our society is based on money and the inherent incentive structures associated with such a system - the vast majority of human beings in the modern world have to tragically engage in largely nonsensical, boring, unfulfilling, unpleasant, manipulative and destructive 'jobs' to be allowed to be alive, earning their right to be alive through this submission to work.

The vast majority of human beings on this planet are not following their genuine passions in their fulfilling careers that help make the world a better place. This whole idea that earning money and they way you go about that defines who and what you are and your value and the idea that it is likely linked to your sincere passions in life; is just utterly untrue and ridiculous to the vast majority of people on earth. Most human beings in adulthood at least are essentially doing this: Going somewhere they don't want to go, to do things they don't want to to, for many hours at a time, having to be around people they don't want to be around, to perform tasks that are fundamentally nonsensical, unpleasant, often inherently manipulative and/or destructive - all in order to be able to pay for rent and food.

This entire set up and behavioral pattern of the human species today is fundamentally unnecessary almost across the board in the modern age - due to the incredible potential of science and technology; which if purposefully oriented to emancipate the human species from drudgery through advanced automation methods - producing a global abundance and eradicating poverty and starvation and homelessness entirely - while of course carefully maintaining ecological equilibrium - could lead to a kind of world, most dare not even dream about due to the current reality of having to submit to labor for survival and the general misery and hardship of the current world.

This future possibility and potential is not a utopia or a perfect naively idealistic dream world, but simply a vastly more sane, rational and pleasant world for humankind which is possible indeed - if only a larger majority of the human species in fact had an awareness of the possibilities of the future humanity we could be moving towards and if people had more information and comprehension about the utter insanity of the current socio-economic system.

I urge anyone who resonates even the slightest bit with what I've written here to look into things like The Zeitgeist Movement, The Venus Project and the concept of a Natural Law Recourse Based Economy  and to listen to or read from for example a philosopher such as Alan Watts talking about these exact topics in great detail in a way that is easy to follow. There are books and talks where he was going through the rational and logic of this kind of thinking - going back all they back to the early 1960's - this can help to get more of an introduction to this train of thought.

These thoughts I have shared just now are not at all new radical ideas so much as very old yet largely suppressed common sense observations that have become somewhat taboo and thus more and more uncommon especially in the media and in the mainstream. A lot of this common sense thinking of course goes directly against what most of us are largely indoctrinated to accept as 'normal' but as Peter Joseph the film maker and social commentator so often has pointed to - we live in a world where normality indeed has become distortion. The economic system we currently live under is in no uncertain terms fundamentally insane at it's very core and to be somewhat depressed and overwhelmed with it's destruction and insanity is in a paradoxical way precisely a sign of sanity. If you are not utterly appalled and astounded by the horrendous state of human society, more specifically in terms of the economic absurdity and madness - you are fundamentally one of 3 things.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Uninformed.
2. Misinformed.
3. In severe denial.

I hope this finds you well as a fellow human being on this planet. All I can really say is I invite you to not passively accept the current economic system which is always expressing itself around you as sane or acceptable because it is anything but if you actually look at it with even the slightest bit of critical analysis.",Here is my big rant on human society and the complete insanity of the economy!!!,60

A vile scheme by the rich, normalized to the point where wanting to live a decent, free life with dignity is actively ridiculed and branded ""lazy"". Fucking disgusting.

Currently trying to make a living from home, self-employed, doing something I'm good at. And I'm enjoying it so I'm not even considering it work.

But for as long as I can remember I chose to observe the world instead of join it. This I guess is a culmination of the 16 years of my lifes observation. People say I'm just depressed or that it's just a phase. Bull. Shit.
If it were a phase wouldn't still feel these things after 7 years.

So far its shit. Not even gonna sugarcoat it.

We dont get a choice in existence, we are ripped from the void, indoctrinated into thinking life is worth living while also being fucked up the ass by wage slavery and 40 hour weeks. On top of that theres the mental and physical shit that can develop, further decreasing lifes ""worth"". From the day we are developed enough to go to school until the day we're too old to work.

People keep saying life is a gift, life is worth living, life is amazing and this and that and this and that and it just keeps going on and on and on and it never ends. It just...never ends.

You know what the definition of insanity is?
It's doing the same shit, over and over again, expecting something to change. We all work, day in and day out, expecting something to pay it all off. But it never comes. The tribulations, the indoctrination, the ignorance, the petty political infighting. And for what? A few minutes of enjoyment?! It doesn't matter, theres no point in existence now, not since slavery and feudalism were created. We are born into lives of suffering and lies.

We are told everything will work out, that everything will get better, that we should be happy to be alive.
But it never will.
It will never get better, we will die, be forgotten, and that's it. Nothing more. The ultimate end.

Thats our reward for all the time wasted working, suffering, crying - death.
P
What's the point in pushing on if the end goal is a return to the eternal void anyway?
The economy ruins our one chance at life. Life is an amazing thing to be enjoyed, but the system the people before us made ruins it for us.
It doesn't help when people say to live life to the fullest and then proceed to get forced into slavery that locks you down with cold chains and holds a blade to your throat if you dare move. 

I'm drained, your drained, they're drained, and for what? Less money that what is needed to survive on top of the plethora of mental and physical disorders we may have? Is our reward the slave owners? The final release from lifes sadistic eyes? It doesn't even matter does it. Death is the only thing guaranteed by the supposed 'lord above'. And I pray the final day of torment arrives soon. 

They say I have my whole life ahead of me, that i should enjoy it while i can because high school is the best time of my life. If this place is the best time of my life I refuse to live any longer because fuck that.
Why should I carry on huh?
WHY?
It will never get better, never be worth the suffering. Nothing will matter anyway I'll be forgotten and returned to the eternal void and cease to exist.
If i killed myself i would be free, if they say suicide only passed on the pain, those people shouldn't have decided to make another poor soul suffer the cycle anyway. I wouldn't care cause I'd be dead and free. If they killed themselves from the strain then good on them! They freed themselves too. If it fails and I unfortunately continue living, I'd be forced even deeper into the hole. Why bother anymore.

It was nice, I got to spend time with my mom and get out of town and I even took an extra day off to recuperate after getting back as vacations can be exhausting in themselves. The extra day off was just spent sleeping and I felt that I wasted it considering the rest of the week was going to be spent catching up on the paperwork and correspondence that was inevitably going to pile up since I'm the only one that knows the ins and outs of my position. Using a measly two days of PTO and the weekend for my vacation has already created overtime for myself and it feels like I'm being punished.

I almost tasted freedom in the trip, but the knowledge of the busy upcoming week was always in the back of my mind. What am I even doing this for? I did not get a higher education after high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do and I'm thankful my younger self didn't incur any debt, I honestly couldn't imagine that pressure. I've worked in my field for around 10 years now and make around 46k annually which I thought was decent considering the no debt situation. I've been frugal and responsible with my money my entire adult life (I'll be 30 this year), but I can't even afford a fucking house in the town I live. With closing costs and a down payment I could comfortably afford a house in the $120-$125,000 range, but guess what? Any houses that price in my town are absolute shitholes or are literally over 100 years old with crumbling foundations. I looked at a foreclosure for $120,000 and the repairs put me way over budget. It's so fucking depressing. I lived my 20s hopping from relationship to relationship, got married then divorced two months later after she cheated on me; I've decided to not try to focus on relationships to find happiness but that also means I probably will never be able to afford a house where I live considering I'd need another's income to help me pay for anything livable. 

So now that working to support a family is out of the picture, what's the point? Like many others in this sub I am so mentally and physically drained at the end of the day that I have no ambition or energy for my hobbies; the weekends are spent catching up on chores and all the books, games, movies, shows, crafts and outdoor activities I like to partake in are brushed aside so that I'm not living in squalor. I'm thankful I have a support group of friends and family to keep me sane, without them I would've committed suicide long ago, but they all seem to be in the same boat I'm in. We regularly gather for board-game nights or dinner but you can see the exhaustion in all of them. Who does this system satisfy? In my area the gap between the poor and blue collar is almost non-existent, one bad week and some of my friends might be financially in shambles. 

I've always fantasized about living in a camper, I've done research and calculated the cost of a yearly lot rental in a town I'd like to live in but I'm afraid to take that leap. My dad is getting older and cuts trees as a side-gig and helping him through the years I would be fairly comfortable taking over that business, I just don't know if there would be enough work throughout the year to support me. If there was a tree or two a week I think I could live comfortably and have the majority of the week to myself to fuck off and pursue my interests, but the fear of not having insurance, getting hurt and being unable to work really does scare me. At the same time, right now I really don't feel like I'm living my one life to anywhere near the extent I could be. Another issue with that plan is being judged for living in a camper in a grungy trailer court; I'd like to say it wouldn't bother me, but it'd be hard to take a friend or date home and expect them not to be sketched out. I also prided myself on carving my own legacy and would be slightly disappointed in myself for having to pick up the business that my dad built, although I think I'd get over that one eventually. Today I've felt hopeless trying to weigh the two options I can think of. I'm not a risk taker but I think something has to change here. Thank you for reading.

I've spent almost 15 years in management and other leadership roles, and in every case I've seen myself and other empathetic people shuffled to the side because our focus was on our people more than the short-term company gains.

More broadly, if you do a Google search for best careers for empaths, the lists you get back are full of service jobs, teaching, school counselor, etc, all of which are pretty low paying, especially if you're talking about someone looking to exit the corporate sector.

Rarely you can find highly empathetic senior leaders and company leaders, often because they helped build the company in the first place, but in my experience most people welcomed into upper leadership put the short-term bottom line before their employees.

The thing is, outsiders to this sub will read that and think I have no idea how business works, except I do. I just reject the idea that it has to work that way. Dan Price is a great example of a highly empathetic leader who puts his employees first, but he built that company and maintained his leadership.

So most people here may be aware that fast food places and restaurants are failing to hire and keep workers...it’s so bad, businesses have been temporarily shutting down and the local Panda Express we just got can not open because no one wants to work for them lol...I saw this coming and me and my inner circle have been talking about this happening for months before news broke. How did we know about this months ahead; simple! I work in the gig industry so I’m always browsing subs from fast food places and restaurants where I deliver food from and you can really see how employees have felt about their work places during Covid..also help wanted signs everywhere at this point

    So what’s going on? Recently, many news outlets have been reporting on this issue and let’s just say, many older folks have gave their input on this situation. Now tell me, how do you tell me you’re American without saying you are? Oh I know! Go on a Facebook rant about how you can’t get your Big Mac and fries now because millennials don’t want to work fast food anymore. No seriously! Hundreds of Facebook comments I’ve been reading from boomers calling us “entitled, lazy, no good generation” all because we don’t want to work fast food. And as I was telling my friend months ago, “look bro, society needs us lower class workers. You know they can’t survive without fast food, groceries, food delivery, etc. Remember the garbage men protests of yesteryear?” And now we are seeing fed up boomers who are mad because we don’t want these jobs anymore because they can’t get their whopper while yelling at the employees for taking too long.

    So who’s to blame? I’ve had the answer to this for months as I saw this coming, but apparently folks, Biden is to blame. Oh yeah, you heard me right. I’m not even a guy that’s into politics and I can tell you how bullshit this is from a galaxy away. All of these comments I’ve seen blaming Biden for extending unemployment which is “why people don’t want to work fast food anymore.” I don’t doubt that people are misusing unemployment, but the rise of people quitting fast food jobs has been rapidly rising over the pandemic. So this was inevitable and to come and restaurants were having issues to keep workers months ago, even before Biden...
Oh yes, blame it on politics for the reason why people don’t want to work fast food anymore.

    
    Here’s what’s really going on. I’ve gone through sub Reddit after sub Reddit of retail stores and restaurants over the past couple of months due to the gig work I do. I always like to see the employee side of things when it comes to the businesses I deliver from to see how I can understand them better and to make my job easier with them...and I’ve come to a conclusion...You all know the answer to fuck it-
*Corporations are to blame.* Yeah we all saw this coming, but surely it can’t be that bad, right? Well, reading employee stories over the pandemic have made me realize something, that employees have been treated like garbage beings over the pandemic and I’ll explain 

   The pandemic was the catalyst in the relationship between corporations and workers. We all know that before the pandemic, these places treated their workers like shit here in America, but the corporations under the pandemic made people get treated like the scum of the earth and opened the eyes for many many people...

    It all started at the beginning of the pandemic, fast food sales doubled and tripled as many people were now ordering online due to the pandemic. What happens when sales double and triple? That must mean that work load doubles and triples too! With all of this new found pressure being put onto fast food workers, while they are understaffed, workers were given too much work with not enough workers....many of whom had to deal with managers yelling at them for not being able to complete impossible rates and customers being angry too. Do you really expect 3 chipotle workers to make 100 items in less than 10 minutes (not even a joke r/Chipotle subreddit confirms)?

   Next came the “Covid pay” fiasco. Many restaurants at first refused to up pay on employees making $7.25 during the pandemic (even when profits soared through to the moon).  As a worker, hearing that you got to work in a business that’s thriving due to a pandemic, and making you do mandatory overtime and not making more, you’re gonna feel like shit bro. Not only as a worker do you have to deal with a pandemic and transmission of the virus due to contact in drive thru with thousands of customers, but your job calls you a “essential hero” but won’t pay you like one....plus too much mandatory overtime for $7.25? Hell no! When these places finally upped pay, it still wasn’t enough

   After the Covid pay issue, managers had gone to the next level of bullshittery. Suddenly, Covid was striking many fast food employees across the country...one by one by one...So what are you supposed to do about this considering your whole kitchen crew are potentially infected? Force your workers to come in...Yes you heard me. Many and I mean many managers verbally threatened their employees if they didn’t come in if they had Covid. Their reasoning was “unless you feel sick or show symptoms, you gotta come in cause we’re understaffed.” That’s how you know you’re really American lol. Oh, your mother you live with got Covid? Too bad, your manager told you that if you quarantine you’re fired. Go ahead and search Reddit and see how many stories you come across like this

   Workers by this point are fed up, but it can’t get worse, can it? Oh yea we can! The next issue is regarding “essential employee” or as I call it, “the most americanest lie established.” Imagine, you work at a ice cream shop at the beginning of the pandemic and you don’t close down...Apparently you’re “an essential worker.” Ice cream tho? Ice cream isn’t essential for survival and apparently many places of business like GameStop came up with bullshit reasons for why they are essential. Don’t get me started on the fact that the mattress job I used to work at during the pandemic, forged a Tennessee official signature, just to lie to the government about being “essential” so they wouldn’t close down (and they got caught and have been fined but ironically, the mattress job has a policy on it’s wall about being loyal to God and the Bible). So you sell Video games during the pandemic-ESSENTIAL! Heard you sell Boba Te-ESSENTIAL! WE ALL ARE ESSENTIAL.

    Finally on our list, we have the “essential hero” lie that was sold by corporate America, to the American people. Brought to you by, the same people who make children pay for their lunch because food brands control kids’ lunch and need to make a buck off of elementary kids (not even a lie, it’s damn true). Anyways, over the pandemic, to really keep employees, corporations ran ads calling their workers “heroes” to increase workplace morale and to make workers feel like they belong; however, with the multiple other events happening in the paragraphs above, that unfortunately did not work to keep workers...instead this backfired. Shocking videos and stories came out about the horrible treatment of so called heroes because people treated fast food workers even worse during the pandemic...hell, the whole “essential hero” thing goes way further than you think. When Americans think about the term “hero,” they think about someone who will put up with all bullshit and never give up...so when Americans (especially older ones who grew up on comic book Superman) hear about fast food employees uh I mean heroes giving up and quitting their jobs, those American people began to view these former workers as scum of the earth...because in the time they grew up, if a hero were to give up, that hero was suddenly a horrible no good person to which they associate these “essential heroes with.” So now , you a former fast food employee who quit their job during the pandemic because they mistreated you like scum, are now seen as scum by older generations for quitting...

And ironically, these same older generations say “fast food isn’t a real job.” Well if it isn’t a real job, why call millennials lazy for not wanting to work fast food? They’re lazy for not wanting to work “non real jobs” huh? Aren’t you guys the same people who said “well if you don’t like it, find a better paying job,” which millennials did take your advice and now you guys are mad about it? Lol


TLDR; Corporations sold the American people lies about employees being “essential heroes” but not wanting to pay anything more than minimum. Same fast food places were forcing workers to come in if they had Covid while treating them even worse during the pandemic. Fast food places nearly tripled in orders but did not have enough staff, which caused extreme pressure and workers working nearly 14+ hours in many cases and greatly increased stress. Many Americans in turn assaulted and harassed workers because food was taking too long when they expect 100 Chipotle items to be done in 10 minutes (not exaggerating). Managers treated employees worse and fast food workers were being treated to inhumane levels. Fast food workers took the boomer’s advice on “finding better paying jobs” and now boomers are mad because no one will make their Big Mac anymore",FastFood/Restaurants fail to retain workers...Boomers most affected/“Biden to Blame” (Rant),343

I will be using gender-neutral pronouns and keeping it as vague as possible because who the fuck knows who lurks this sub so sorry for any confusion.

&amp;#x200B;

So this was in 2018. I applied through a temp agency and got placed in a warehouse pick/pack position. Normally I am completely averse to warehouse work, but this was a very small setting and is owned by the family of an extremely famous musician who you've heard of. The direct supervisor and supervisor of the warehouse were both great to work for. I started as a packer, then they transitioned me to being a picker, where I excelled to the point that eventually I was doing pretty much anything they needed me to do. I didn't mind because, again, I liked working for the people, it wasn't a hard job, and it was Monday-Friday with no mandatory overtime. For a warehouse that is fucking unheard of. The commute was only about 20 minutes as well, which was nice.

Anyway. For about three months I was probably the most trusted employee there (as far as the regular employees went). There were a lot of shitty workers, and by that I mean workers who would come in, talk and fuck around on their phones, then get mad when they were reprimanded for it and start talking shit about the bosses. One of the people who worked there was a close friend of the boss, and we became really good friends as well. A lot of these people would talk shit about this person too or even straight up bully them to their face, which pissed me off. I ended up basically becoming the warehouse supervisor's eyes and ears, they wanted me to report shit like that because it creates a toxic workplace and they didn't want people like that working there. I agreed with it and was totally fine with doing it. I respected the supervisor, the person they were friends with was my friend now too, and I can't fucking stand being around workplace bullies either.

About five months in, shit completely changed, and I still to this day have no idea what it was. The direct supervisor started cold-shouldering me. The warehouse supervisor was suddenly distant as hell. That probably sounds weird, but before this they would often come into the break lounge on my lunch breaks and we'd shoot the shit for a while. I'm an aspiring novelist and I'd usually bring in my laptop to work on my writing. It turned out they used to live right down the road from one of my favorite authors (again, you've heard of this person), and the supervisor showed me the pictures of their house they had on their phone. They'd ask me about shit out of work, ask how my novel was coming, what it was about, etc. Same thing with my direct supervisor, just not as often because they weren't as available for obvious reasons.

Shit kept getting worse, to the point where if I made one little mistake it was the end of the fucking world. I was reported for giving ""pushback"" to my supervisor (no idea what the fuck they were on about, because I never did anything but what they asked me to the best of my ability). At one point the supervisor just straight blew up on me because I mistakenly grabbed a box of product from one of the trucks that we didn't need yet (there was an unopened box on the floor, on a fucking shelf behind another box that I guess I was just supposed to magically know about). This was on Friday. At the end of the shift they sort of apologized and we seemed cool again, and the warehouse supervisor came out to talk to me about random shit again near the end of the day. I figured maybe they'd just been having bad days or something.

Went home that day, two hours later got an email telling me not to come back Monday. No explanation or anything, just ""Do not return to work on Monday"" with the subject line ""Assignment Ended"". Still, to this day, don't know what the fuck I did. That was the last time I ever put serious effort into a job. I did a shitload of extra work for these people because I actually respected them, there was one day I skipped my lunch break because a bunch of people called out and the supervisors needed help with a specific project. I volunteered for it just because I wanted to help out. My thanks was being shitcanned without any notice whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

The moral of this long tale is: Never fucking go above and beyond for these shit jobs, because you can literally break your back for these people and they'll just use that as an excuse to fire you. Never bother with a two week notice because they will let you go at the end of your shift without an explanation or anything resembling advance notice. I guarantee you they had decided to fire me but waited until the end of my shift so they could get one more day of labor out of me.

Never do above the bare minimum for these people, especially without being told. NEVER. They do not give a fuck about you. To them, you are human labor. Human capital. You are sentient time. Anything BUT human, basically.

I work in customer services and this is telephone, webchat and email based work - Some of it is targeted but the job is just about manageable and fluctuates between really busy and sometimes a little quieter than expected. 

Anyway, they've paid these ""experts"" to come and do the usual cuts. Lunches are now going from 45 mins to 30 which is just a pain the ass because we handle complaints mostly and that can get a little much and most times 30 min lunches are not enough to eat and relax after in order to come back to the job somewhat relaxed. I did ask and got told that they could only have a couple of people on lunch at the same time, around 4 in total i think. So the obvious solution is to employ more staff to avoid the burn out but that's only obvious if you actually give two shits about your staff. I'll be damned if im calling their ""helpline"" number to discuss my shitty mental health that they will inevitability cause with all of the changes their about to implement.

I have a 1st class bachelors degree in physics and a masters degree in nuclear science from Manchester. I have also published work in a journal during my undergrad degree so my academic achievements weren't all about box ticking and memorising information to pass exams. A-levels were 15 years ago now so they are irrelevant, but I got  2As and 2Bs. Lots of A\*s and As at GCSE. I also did this whilst going  to poor performing schools in Manchester with &lt;25% of pupils getting  5A\*-C.

Did it all lead to a good career? Did it fuck. It has led me nowhere. Now I admit, I have not been as  proactive as I could have been due to social anxiety, but I at least expected to find a job relatively soon after graduating. My job history is poor - temp work in admin, exam marking and retail. I have been  surviving by living with my parents and off my savings (I was even paid £5000 and given a stipend for my masters degree - so you would think the university / nuclear industry would be desperate to place me in a job with such incentives). It's bizzare. The whole jobs market is bizzare.

I applied to Tescos (supermarket) recently as a picker and packer. I sat their psychometric test and received an email straight away to say I had passed, but now nothing. I also applied to a school admin job and heard nothing. This is what always happens - I apply for jobs and hear nothing back, even though they are not high level.

My situation right now? Applied to graduate entry medicine in September and had three interivews. Also applied again to the NHS scientist training programme in medical physics. What if none of this come off? I don't know. Re-train in something else but end up right back in this situation?

Until I start getting opportunities nothing will change. I don't know how it is in North America or Australia or Asia, but this UK job market is insane. No one wants to train people like me. I also represent my running club. I am in perfect shape and communication skills aren't too shabby.",Short rant about my weird situation,13

So I'm kinda fuming. I was scheduled to work an 11 and a half hour shift today, which isn't too abnormal, except today, wasn't given a break until i got in a argument with a coworker and mentioned how it was against federal (U.S.) law for this to happen. Which would have been avoided if they had just let me go home early. I had asked for a break several hours before I was scheduled to get off, however I was not allowed anything but a 5 min sit. (which BTW is not the required time for working 8+ hours) so considering I didn't get my break, I asked to go home 30 min early, which was again denied. So I was starting to get exhausted, emotional, and reactive. One of my coworkers said something close to ""if you had been more caught up/faster then you would have been able to get a break."" Which is just not true, and irrelevant. ~~Federal law (which trumps my states' law) says that a 30 min break must be provided if an employee has worked 8 or more hours, and another 15 min for every 4 hours past that.~~ Edit: I looked in to it more and I was wrong about the federal laws, unfortunately. However Casey's does have a policy regarding employee breaks, that definitely was not followed by my managers. So I stated that it was illegal for me to not receive a break and someone should have covered for that time. Which would have been doable, there were others who could cover my break. This apparently startled my management, as I soon had a chat with my store manager and a 2nd assistant. They basically said that Kansas (my state) has no such laws, and I should have communicated my needs better (I asked several times and made it clear how I had not been allowed my break) and that ""these days happen"". Bull. Shit. It is immoral and illegal to force someone to work 11 and a half hours with no break. There is no ""it happens"" I ended up spending the last 30 min of my shift writing this post, probably only because they were scared HR or a lawyer might get involved. If only I had the money to hire a lawyer.

My bosses are awful. I was hired as a manager, but really I'm just an associate. I've run far bigger wineries than this one, single handedly.

I'm salary, and he insists I come in at 9 am, but we don't even open until 11, and I'm finished with my morning tasks by 915. I just stand around looking busy. He blames me for everything. It was an ice storm yesterday, so after a few hours, the wife sent me home. I said I'd stay on top of social media and emails. At around 3 I checked my email again, (I was checking every 30-45 minutes) and I had like 10 emails within a 30 minute span scolding me because they were ""slammed and the customers said the roads were FINE!"" and asking me ""ARE YOU EVEN THERE! PEOPLE ARE ASKING US QUESTIONS ON FACEBOOK AND YOU AREN'T ANSWERING!"" the message on Facebook they were referring to was from the husband. He had messaged the business page, saying ""do you have a question"". And I had responded to it. So the wife tells me to drive back in. I get there an hour before we close. the wife is in her snowsuit going sledding with their grandson. He has a newspaper open on the bar.  I check sales, and it was not busy. The husband has terrible time management skills, and can't adjust his service speed when it's busy. He starts telling me how crazy busy it was, but how he can handle it, and then pulls up the reports. I know he thought it would be much better than it was, but I just stood there. I can see the moment he realizes his numbers weren't great, and then he starts scolding me for ""refunding all the reservations instead of rescheduling them"" and asked if I even tried. He was trying to find a reason his numbers sucked. Problem is, I only refunded 1 reservation, and rescheduled the rest. I told him this and he tried pulling up different dates to like, trick me into thinking I refunded more? I don't know. It was insane.

They don't let managers send out basic emails without getting approval. Seriously. Last week, I sent an email out, that the wife had literally written and emailed to me for me to send out. Apparently that wasn't approval enough? I was somehow supposed to know it wasn't ready to send? It contained a link to the website of a nearby bnb. They were angry I sent the email (that they wrote and sent me) without getting approval? And said that because of that email, that I had redirected the bnb Facebook page to our Facebook page. There was literally nothing about Facebook in the email. No link whatsoever to any Facebook. I said it wasn't possible, but they maintain that I did this by sending the email.

I got scolded for not checking to see if he used the correct gate code. Didn't know that was a thing.

We switched software, to one I've used extensively, and he knows that, and he's never used it, and he is insisting that I'm doing it wrong, and it won't look good. I know exactly what I'm doing, and he's not even seen what it will look like. That's all after the fact that I told him for the first 3 months I was here that our software was compromised and not secure, and he would get sooooo angry at me about it. I was right. 100s of people had their cc info stolen. 

FedEx picks up on Friday. An order came in on Sunday. I told the customer it would go out the next week. The wife asked me on Sunday if I needed anything from town over our weekend (Monday and Tuesday) and I told her that I had a package. She said she didn't want to go to FedEx. I said OK. Friday comes, so does FedEx, and I get scolded by the husband because we didn't get the package out earlier. I told him what his wife said, but it was still my fault.

I just am wasting my life here. I think all day about what I'd rather be doing, all the projects I could do, classes I could take, but instead I stand here, pretending to be busy (it's winter and covid, we are slow af). My 30s are just disappearing.",I hate working. **rant...sorry **,15

Animals (especially pets) do not have to work, but they never stop doing it. They wake up everyday and hunt for their meals, protect their turf, take care of their young, and all kinds of other productive activities, yet take constant breaks to relax and reflect. They successfully do all that every day without the motivation from soul crushing man-made constructs. 



If we were to look at nature for inspiration and education (as we should), we would conclude that living in small (loose or tight-knit) anarchical or semi-anarchical communities, utilizing nature, yet taking care of and sustaining it, (instead of hierarchically exploiting each other and destroying what little nature we have left) would be a favorable lifestyle.



The current global system is falling and failing and crushing us under its own weight in the process. Yet it is insanely defensive against any type of real change unto to itself for one simple reason, which is that the people that are dependent on it have all the arms and power.



Every time the system is shaken, or been under a crisis it gets up weaker, yet even more resistant of change.



As we saw, the system is mad with an insatiable hunger and is fueled by excess, it has to inflate because it would die if it stops. Consumption has to increase every day more than the one before or the system will find itself in danger. Do we really need more beef and dairy farm? Haven't we reached the point of equilibrium and sufficiency yet? Aren't all the farms of the world enough to feed the population times and times over? If this wasn't true then why is there so much waste?



A world run by monetary incentive isn't natural or healthy for body or mind. The fact that fairness is destructive to the workplace says a lot about the nature and the state of how healthy the work environment is. Working fair hours, having a fair workload, appropriate number of employees, getting paid a fair wage, and any other fair practices are destructive to the workplace. Why would we care about saving such a place?



To save man (body and soul), more power should be transferred to the workers than the owners. Humans aren't lazy, human ingenuity is infinite, and therefore conditions should be set to support and utilize this boundless ingenuity. If someone can't find a job, whether it be because of lack of opportunities, inhumane working conditions, or laughable wages, a tax proportional to the unemployment rate should be taken out of companies and redistributed to people serious about looking for a job; thus encouraging new businesses and competition, while also hitting companies where it hurts and incentivizing them to hire more and improve their work conditions.



Humans aren't lazy or stupid, they don't need bosses or management to make them work, it is just that the current state of the workplace has taken out the value out of labor with it's bureaucracy and practices. Handymen and craftsmen and other independent workers were always a part of society and we need more of them and less of big and international companies.

Companies shouldn't be allowed to dominate or do inhumane or monopolistic practices to cut costs, even vertical supply companies should be broken down to allow more competition. These practices might raise costs, and price of goods, but also raise wages (especially for the poorest amongst us) and give us more equality, creativity, and freedom to change jobs and careers.



For now:

1. Consume less. 2. Work proportionally to your wage. 3. Buy local. 4. Try not to work for evil corporations or individuals.",I wrote this poorly written hardly coherent rant out of frustration.,12

In the surveys that they've sent out the majority of the people had a very positive response.

Since then the offices have slowly and partially reopened, now with the people that cant/don't want to wfh working from the office. Currently at less than 5% capacity.

Of course with working from home there are some additional problems that can arise, Internet and electricity issues may not be common, but with several thousands of employees it wouldn't be weird that it happens.

**However** they will now roll out a new policy where any downtime will be taken out of your pay, or you will need to use PTO. Their reasoning for this was that there are apparently people who haven't worked at all since March and it's losing the company a lot of money.

Now the obvious question is why they wouldn't just do something about the people not working instead. 

But the worst part is that they brought up an example, where the city was doing maintenance on the fibre of her street, and knocked out the Internet of the whole street for 2 days. It could've been the ISP or whatever but the point still stands. A situation completely out of your control just caused you to lose 2 days pay. And you can't just drop into the office as that needs to be planned 7+ days in advance.

The even more interesting thing is that we have paid sick days, so if you get a power outage the most financially wise decision is to call in sick. 

They did however say that in extraordinary circumstances there may be exceptions. The example given was if there was a city wide power outage.

Now this may be understandable if internet/power issues were common. I can of course only speak of my team but I don't think anyone in my team in the past 9 months have had issues more than once.

I had worked for them, but was laid off right as the pandemic started, was told by my manager that I WASN'T and that this was happening to everyone at the store and to be patient, then found out  later through a co-worker that I was actually laid off. No call from my manager, no text, nothing. I'm 22 years old and I am honestly tired of being told to accept shit like this. I got written up once for not noticing a fork behind a garbage can, told I wasn't 'professional', told that when I asked if I could switch to pet care that I would be 'someone elses problem' if they did (I have ADD and was in the middle of getting new meds, which I made sure they were aware of. Funny considering how the first day of my job I was sat down to watch training videos and do quizzes and one of their first guidelines is that employees who might need accommodation are not only entitled to it, but encouraged to seek it out if needed.) All I was asking for was a bit of understanding while I was getting my meds sorted out: not to be treated like royalty. Not only did I not get understanding, but my manager took to hiding things under shelves for me to find to make sure I was ""cleaning properly."" She also got mad when I would miss pee stains somewhere in the store (it is one of the bigger stores, and I KNOW I did my best keeping up with it.) and went on about how it would turn pet parents away, but would LEAVE IT THERE FOR DAYS TO SHOW ME WHEN I WAS SCHEDULED NEXT? So it was okay for the pee to be left then, but not when I missed it?? One of the real kickers was when it was December of last year, 5am I'm waiting outside the store to be let in for my shift. It's snowing, freezing cold and nothing is open. My manager showed up TWO HOURS late and was snarky the entire shift. Last but not least, the shit show that was petcare. There were a few good people there, but not good enough apparently because animals was consistently escaping from the room behind petcare. Three times in one month it was a python that I FOUND when I was cleaning under the isles. Another time it was a robo hamster on the brink of death because it had escaped and had been gone for who knows how long. A majority of the time the bottles in the cages were set up WAY too high and the hamsters couldn't reach them. You'd think a PET store would actually take better care of their animals. 

All in all, I have no hope for the future right now. This pandemic, the fact that money rules EVERYTHING, and the fact that the system works to create mindless wage slaves as opposed to enlightened and free people, makes me feel so sick I want to throw up.

Sometimes i wish it was still the 1950s and i was supposed to be a housewife. I feel like saying that is like saying you're a n*zi but honestly i really do feel like that. I know women deserve to be treated equal to men and have the opportunity to educate themselves and work. In fact from what I've seen women/girls outperform men/boys quite often. But the right to education and the right to work is not the freedom for women as some people think it is and society makes it out to be in my opinion. V awkward because I've always considered myself a feminist.

For me, eventhough as a child i was labeled smart i cannot help but wish my life was different. Again, it feels weird to say that because i am a woman living in a first world country in the 21st century- how could i possibly complain? Well, i always thought of the ability to work as freedom. But as I've grown up i realized i have little. A job is what you need to feed yourself and your family. An education is a requirement and a completely soulsucking experience that will also leave you with not only the wish you were struck by lighting or hit by a bus every once in a while but a nice debt.


Speaking of family, i wish I could have one but how am i gonna combine that without impacting my career and in this economy? I dream of having a big family sometimes but can't imagine having more than 2. A child is so incredibly expensive and time consuming from what I've heard. Daycare costs alone... it makes me sad. i also feel like getting a house is gonna be so hard. I am nineteen and already constantly thinking about money. I still live at home and don't lend money because i don't wanna fucking go into debt when all my pimples haven't even disappeared yet lol.

My dreams of becoming an astronaut or hockey player or whatever the fuck i soon realized were completely  unrealistic. I am but my competences and weaknesses and there will unfortunately always be too many that outperform me at every fucking thing i do. Didn't choose the right subjects when you were 15 and had no clue how important it would be? Sorry, you're fucked now. 

Futhermore, with every major I'm reading on (im switching majors) i get extremely worried about the job market and how people are gonna perceive my major and job. I am sorry society, but i prefer history and english over math and psychics. People around me tell me, don't worry. But how can i not worry? Every major i like gets ridiculed and I hear stories about ppl studying it and not getting a job. Psychology? ""After you finish that you stil got nothing."" X? ""You should just learn how to get on benefits in the mean time."" Also, many people here are highly educated. Meaning that a bachelors that used to be considered impressive is now a requirement. I feel so much pressure to not be an embarrassment and do a prestigous major (eventhough I truly want to do something most people think is riduclous) and have a successful career. I look at my female friends who were smarter than me and do prestigous majors and feel like a failure. I long for a simpler life with less stress. Honestly i am a total homebody and love cooking etc.. and i despise the idea of having to go to a soulsucking 9 to 5 job with a boss that dictates me around. Think I'm too pessimistic? It's just reality for many people. I will try to get a job i like and a major i like, but at the end of the day we all need to pay our bills. But all society does is tell me to suck it up and think of the people in third world countries that have it worse. 

The parttime jobs I've had were hell and make me pretty scared for the future. I could write about them for hours. Mistreatment when you weren't your boss' BFF, having to stand for 8 hours behind the cash register with less than 1 hour break, being the only one on the floor while it was busy and i had worked there for 3 months bc my boss and coworkers wanted to get lunch. Being paid scraps. Not being paid for more than 30 minutes everytime i worked, but 5 minutes late qnd you commited a war crime. Hearing the music from the store and feeling like i was on a boat at the end of the day in bed. I cannot imagine what is must like to be poor and not be able to quit a job. At least i have something to fall back on, somewhat of a choice, some freedom. But god i cannot wait to be financially independent and god am i jealous of people like Kylie Jenner.

I am expecting negative reactions, maybe i am somewhat of a brat. But it feels good to get ny thoughts out and felt like this subreddit won't be too judgemental.","Rant on work, from a teenanger's perspective",13

I'd be applying for a job with an actual benefit to society and it would even pay better than the job I have now.

Of course, I still have to go through the motions of investing my own time into drafting a letter to explain why they should give the job to me, showcasing that I stand out from all the other applicants like I'm in a fucking talent show in which the winner gets to work to ensure rent payments. But that's fine, this is one of the few times that I'm actually excited about a listing, so I suck it up and start spending a couple of hours on that letter, choosing my words carefully and musing on what I need to put in there to make sure they understand how suited I would be for the position. 

The deadline for the application was the 14th. I was working on my letter when I pull up the website to check the listing, just to make sure that my highlighted competencies correspond to the demands in the listing and it's... closed. They just fucking closed the listing. No explanation. It just says 'closed'.

I've now invested hours of my own time on something that is instantly completely irrelevant because of this bullshit system in which a worker has to invest their own time and resources to show an employer that they are worthy of providing value to them and the realization's just hit me hard.

When I come home from college for winter or summer break, I’m put back on the schedule to make a little extra cash between semesters. I’m a trusted, valued employee and my boss often reminds me of as much, and I am one of four out of twelve employees at this location trusted with a store key despite the fact that I only work there for a month to three at a time. 

For brief backstory, the coffee shop I work at is very understaffed. Where we used to be open until 9 pm, we’re now only open until 7 pm and, before I came back, hours were reduced to being open until 1 pm with a staff of just four people. The management of the coffee shop is, in my opinion, sloppy and, in the states opinion, illegal. 

Among many other past offenses, my boss has forbidden us from discussing our wages (illegal), discouraged us from taking breaks (illegal) by telling us that ‘Oh, we just don’t take breaks here!’ and only scheduling two baristas for any given shift so we can’t leave the store without abandoning the other, and disallowed us from sitting in the cafe area while not providing any seating in the back and disciplining us when she finds us sitting on the tables or floor in the kitchen where the customers can’t see us during our eight hour shifts (probably illegal?).

When I came back in the beginning of December, I immediately knew someone had reported her behavior. Within the first fifteen minutes of my first shift back, my boss informed me that we are required to take our (federally mandated) breaks because she ‘had no idea you guys weren’t taking breaks!’ and, suddenly, enough people were scheduled for us to do so. Because of Covid, our cafe is closed and she said that the couches were treated as a place to sit when we weren’t working. Everything seemed a lot better. 

Maybe it’s the rise of communist ideologies in my brain or my general discontent with capitalism, but I quickly realized that I was being asked to do *much* more work than I was being compensated for. On top of me training the mostly new staff on tasks they should have learned during their actual training with our boss, I was given the title of Senior Barista, making me responsible for my and the other employees side work being completed while i was on shift and locking up and opening the store when I worked.

I know being a barista is a relatively cushy job, but I get paid minimum wage ($7.25/hour in my state) and my back has been in constant pain for a month straight from standing all day. In addition, our boss told other employees that business has never been better because the Starbucks near us has shut down for a quarantine period. I also am often closing, because other baristas have time commitments at night, where I walk away with $5-$10 in tips as opposed to the morning shift’s $30-$40. 

So, about a week ago I asked my boss for a raise. My boss, we’ll call her Sarah, owns the franchise location I work at of a small chain of coffee shops. The following is basically how the conversation went with me having memorized the first thing I said to reduce my anxiety about talking to her about it. 

Me: I’ve been thinking a lot lately about my worth to Company, and between being a Senior Barista, training new employees, functioning as a manager when you’re not in the store, I my labor is worth more than I’m being paid. Last night, I closed the store alone and not only was it done well, I completed it earlier than most other employees could. While I have no issue with the fact that I closed the store alone, the fact that I did and that you trusted me to do so shows how valuable my labor is to Company. These are just a few of the reasons that, after three years of hard work, I am asking for a raise to reflect this. 

Sarah: I agree that your labor is valuable to Company, and I appreciate everything you do, but we just don’t have a structure set up for giving raises. When we formally establish a title that comes with a raise, we can talk. 

Me: I thought that was the function of Senior Barista? To show that we’re the more experienced team members who have more responsibility. 

Sarah: Well, we’ve also had issues in the past of some employees getting paid more than others and discussing that, leading to employees asking for a raise and quitting when I tell them they don’t work hard/well enough to play one. 

(I started to get what she was saying and played along.)

Me: I don’t plan on discussing my wage with other employees. 

Sarah: Well, I know you would t do something like that and of course I would never ask that of you (haha), but so close to the holidays is such a stressful time for me and my family and I’m sure understand. 

Me: I understand that you’re busy, but I’ve put in a lot of hard work for Company and I think you know I would only talk to you about this if it was something I really believed in. 

Sarah: Well, how about we talk about it the next time you come back? I’m sure we’ll have something figured out by then! (I had already told her I most likely wouldn’t be returning because I’ll be graduating from college soon)

So, I took the hint, thanked her for her time, and hung up. Recently, one of my coworkers who worked at a franchise location owned by someone different told me that at their old store, the title of Senior Barista always comes with a $1/hour raise. 

So, now I don’t really know what to do. I’ve been trying to discipline myself into only doing minimum wage level work, but that just fucks over my coworkers who are also making minimum wage. I guess I’m just frustrated and wanted to rant to likeminded people? idk",Asked for a raise recently [rant],5

The fuck do I do now?


Without going into obscene detail, I worked in a professional office setting, and left the company/country to pursue something completely different. After a few years, shit happened and I needed to come back home, and also chose to go back to my employer. I worked out a unique deal with my employer which gave me tremendous freedom of schedule/time/hours worked, no benefits (to which I agreed) but complete with your typical profit-driven, dehumanizing attitude about work. The work itself is very tedious, and frankly, boring.

Over the years since returning, so has the malaise about the job itself. Not sure if it’s the actual work, the toxic environment, or my own existential crisis that life is more than 40 hours a week of making profit for others. 

In these years since returning, to put it plainly, my employer fucked up. They are legally required to provide certain benefits, even if part-time (which I technically was due to previously mentioned situation), and they didn’t. I brought it up, they “fixed it”, but it still wasn’t correct. Brought it to them again, finally fixed it. 

Since that experience, though, some other bullshit has happened regarding benefits. I reached a tipping point last week where more negligence was shown by my employer, and I had to get loud. 

 I exploded on them (as professionally as possible, while still conveying my message), and pretty much said, “I have been patient and gracious with your misgivings, and then you have the AUDACITY to say that your errors happened because I’m the only employee with this situation?”, as though that excuses their violation of law. 

So, we are in talks, they are “trying to make things right”. I have an opportunity to probably name my package at this point, as they (likely) fear litigation, even though that’s not really something I want/would do. 

My heart knows I want/need to leave. My finances (student loan debt $45K, mortgage $109k) tell me otherwise. AND, even if I did leave, I have no real goals/inspirations/dreams to pursue. 

I don’t even have a question to ask at the end of this...I just feel confused, conflicted, scared, and depressed. And I know a lot of others here do, too. I’m not lazy. I’m not anti-labor. I’m anti-fucking people over, wringing them out of their energy, time, mental health, and their lives, just to turn a profit. But I also don’t see a way out...",Employer conundrum / a rant,4

This is also kind of a work biography going through each of my jobs and how they ruined my faith in work.

Sex work has always been the kind of thing I've joked about doing but something that I'd never actually considered doing as a means to actually earn an income. Over the last few weeks though I've actually been thinking about doing it as a living, more specifically escorting.

I've grown up in a fairly middle class household, always having secure housing, parents having work, never needing to worry especially about money as a kid. I even ended up going to a grammar school (not through heavy tutoring or anything, I just showed up and got lucky on the test), I was always seen as a gifted boy. Then things began to not work out as well, I could never concentrate at school, I didn't do homework or anything like that. For GCSEs I did great, got plenty of A*s, but I got kicked out of school after my AS results weren't good enough. I just couldn't work in a classroom environment, I couldn't pay attention, I couldn't absorb information and I couldn't write large amounts. Something was just not right.

I then enrolled in a college to do an IT course, it was a BTEC or something like that, as I'd grown interested in computers and hardware in my time at home. I spent 4 months in that course then came to a realisation, I already knew all of the shit they were teaching, I then looked through the curriculum, I knew all that too (apart from programming but that was never my thing), so I just left the course. I'm not spending 2 years on a course that will teach me nothing of any use. 

I ended up just applying to jobs and apprenticeships, I ended up getting one with a little ISP doing tech support for customers. I actually enjoyed it for the first couple of months, then it went downhill, I on many occasions was the only person with technical knowledge in work at that time, having literally 2 months experience and being the sole tech person for 6,000 customers is not a fun time. I couldn't keep up with ticket writing or form filling, I couldn't pay attention enough, I'd forget customer names, but most of all... I was just so exhausted. I got let go after 4 months for turning up late after working 2 hours unpaid overtime the day before.

I began to think something was wrong with me.

At this point it was late November, so I decided to get a Christmas job in a Sainsbury's. There was basically no interview process or training. I sat in a room and watched a video for 3 hours, most of which was about things completely irrelevant to me. Then I was told to shadow someone for a few hours, they showed me how the till worked and that was it. Next day I was on the till, it was the most stressful job I've ever done. On my third day I had a panic attack on the till because there was a huge queue, I'd given someone the wrong change, I couldn't open the till until I'd finished with the next customer because stupid design, my line manager wasn't responding, the Christmas songs were blaring and the ""PLEASE PREPARE TO PUSH THE TROLLY OFF THE END OF THE CONVEYER"" announcement had been going on for 3 hours. I had a panic attack on the till.  I turned up the next day to resign. I had physical symptoms from that day for nearly an entire year.

I knew something was wrong, I spent ages online looking through things to see what was wrong with me. I found it, autism. It fit perfectly, it explained everything and after a year long process I got a diagnosis. High-functioning ASD. That was it, there was no support, no therapy, no help. Just a piece of paper and an information booklet which was just an NHS website printout. 

During this time period I found another job, working in a little computer repair shop. This was a job I genuinely enjoyed, at least for a while. It started with me just going there for a few Saturdays to see if they liked me and to learn some stuff. After a couple of months I got offered a contract. I worked part time and enjoyed it, problem solving and all that stuff has always been enjoyable. It was still exhausting though, lots of killing time while trying to look busy and all that stupid shit.

(((TW: ABLEIST SLURS, SUICIDE)))

Then one day, the owner didn't come in. After I had said goodbye to him on Saturday, he went home and hung himself. I still don't know why or if I could have helped in any way, but he was a genuinely lovely guy. Then the old owner took back over, the entire atmosphere changed. Imagine a UKIP voter and Del Boy were one person, that was him. One day I took a call from the advocate for an autistic guy, asking if there was any chance of doing some work experience or volunteering at the shop, so I asked the boss, who said ""Tell them I don't want none of those window-lickers in here"". That just hurt me so much, that was literally how I came to work there, just my uncle instead of an advocate. If he knew I was autistic like the old boss did, or the other member of staff did he would treat me exactly the same. Shortly after my contract ended, wasn't renewed and I left. 

The next and longest job I've had was working at a council as a Systems Engineer Apprentice. I have no idea why I still needed to be employed as an apprentice with over a year's experience doing this but that's besides the point, the pay was not that bad. I got paid the over 25s minimum wage, which was definitely an upgrade, although still not really enough to move out. The work was so empty it was crazy, I'd spend entire days sitting at my desk doing absolutely nothing, but still having to pretend to be useful and active. Most of my job was filling out forms, forwarding customer emails to suppliers, vice versa and deleting and undeleting social care records. On top of this, my apprenticeship was in software development, something I didn't do, and no-one on the payroll did, all software development and engineering was handled by external companies, so I couldn't do any paperwork on my apprenticeship. This was the point where my anxiety reached its peak, I'd spend 3 hours a day in the toilet at work trying to keep myself calm, the rest of the day I'd sit at my desk reading confidentiality social care records to give me something to do so I didn't go absolutely crazy. I broke laws on council property and invaded the privacy of vulnerable people so I didn't go mad.

I eventually got some therapy, CBT, which I had applied for before even starting work there. It didn't work for me, which is quite common among autists, so they thought of something which could help. They told me to do something I would never do in a million years, I went to a furry meet in the middle of London with hundreds of complete strangers. I'd never had any friends, no-one really liked me, but in that massive group of people I met some who actually cared about me and that has been the thing that has most changed my life for the better. However, there was still work. Work that exhausted me, meant 10 hour days, not having the energy to do anything on weekends. That was the issue that was holding down everything, my pointless job where I did nothing for 8 hours stressed out of my mind then drove an hour home so tired I regularly fell asleep at the wheel. 

I kept up that job for a year, until I had a complete breakdown when I had a realisation, I was transgender. The day of that, I drove into work, and then just cried in the car for 3 hours, one hour of which was on call to one of my new friends. Then I booked a doctor's appointment and drove home, still crying. I spent 4 months on paid sick leave, until it ran out, then I resigned. The shock of that and the stress of work caused a heavy and suicidal depression.

The depression lasted about a year, I blew through all of the money I'd saved, my parents bailed me out of £1k of credit card debt. But for that time, despite my depression, I had a really good time, I was free, I didn't have to spend the entire week in a shitty office, I could see people, I wasn't locked down to staying at home the entire time, I could spend a day or 3 round a friend's house. It was wonderful. The worst shit my chemically imbalanced brain could throw at me couldn't come close to a desk job.

My favourite times during all of that was being intimate with people, it wasn't even the sex or the sensations or anything like that, it was just being wanted. Having someone find me, attractive and get off and have a good time because of me, is just amazing. There were even times I was with someone who I wasn't even really attracted to or who they were wasn't appealing, but I would still suck them off or have them fuck me because making someone feel that good is beautiful.

Then the lockdown hit, everything stopped, I've seen a friend maybe 5 times since February and that's my ace best friend (love him). There are two good things to have come out of lockdown for me. The first was the extra £20 per week in UC, that's allowed me to start HRT privately and results are beginning to show though very nicely. 8 months in now and I'm so much happier in my own skin. Secondly, time to think, think about what I want to do and where I want to be. I've had an idea for a long time about doing a computer repair business, fixing PCs for old people either in their home or at my home. I'd actually been doing this for a bit before the pandemic, I could never find much work in it though, making under £100 most months and I can't see it getting much better. Even if I did get more work, I would end up spending so much time doing stuff it would just be far too much work for me, I'd get exhausted again.

I then just one day randomly entertained to idea of becoming an escort, and I figured out it would actually suit me very well. I'm pretty attractive, I always have been tall and lean with very clear skin. I'm perfectly okay with weird and wonderful kinks (I've done ABDL and all sorts of other strange crap with people, I like to please :3). I'm a trans woman, that gives me somewhat of a niche (also having a niche as opposed to being denied jobs would be a fucking god send). What I've been doing is literally going round strangers houses when they call me, just with a bag of screwdrivers not a bag of condoms and sex toys. I love to make people feel good and get people off. I love people finding me attractive. I would get to control when I work and with who. I wouldn't have to work extremely long monotonous hours.

I know there are downsides, mainly around safety, but that is just far too many benefits to give up. I just want to be able to live in a house or flat without working stupid hours and having someone else own me and be stressed out at a desk all day.

Anyway, I had reached a few final stage interviews over the past few months. Every one was outright horrible/ made me eyeroll. If I keep on doing interviews, I might end up getting PTSD from the humiliation and debasement.

In the end, I accepted the offer from the interviewer who wasn't snobbish. He was genuinely curious about my past experience without being condescending.

I have met interviewers who probed about my privacy. They want to know my educational history down to elementary school, why I didn't stay in the States post-graduation to work (I'm non-American) and also wanted to dig deeper into the health issue (which is depression that I'd rather not reveal).

There were also two guy interviewers who made sure to put me in a tight spot. One of them made a snide remark when I was elaborating on my skillset. He probably was not impressed that I would choose to talk about such a ""basic"" skill. Honestly, if employers did not turn interviews into hunger games, we didn't have to bullshit them all the time.

One interviewer wanted to know my passion and specified that he didn't want textbook answers. I already knew by then that the work must be demanding and exploitative. I hate it when people glorify their jobs and the hustle. If he wants a ""passionate"" worker, I'm sorry to say that I'm not one. I won't do a sloppy job either, just don't use those buzzwords that make me want to puke.

The most horrible experience must be the ""I want to know all"" interviewer, asking irrelevant questions and invading my privacy. He also kept telling me that I won't be a good fit and bitched about his work environment to me. I hated that dude to the core so when their HR extended an offer, I turned it down without a second thought.

I have learned from experience\* that if you hate the people who interview you, it's likely that you'll hate the job. Being antiwork + bad work environment is a devastating combo.

\*My ex-boss was my final interviewer. He spent an hour to tear apart my resume and acted all snobbish. as if I should be grateful that they were giving me an offer. Hated that dude too.",Is it just me or recent interviewers are getting worse and meaner (rant/vent),55

I’m very happy I can work from home since corona so I can actually do things I enjoy doing with my day however I am dreading going back to the office from 9-6, (9-5 on a Friday as an “early finish” - wtf?) and staring at a screen doing nothing for 6 hours.

Or my favourite pointless task is when my boss asks me to add in links (literally just copying and pasting URLs of products) into a google sheet when it would taken her 2 mins to do it herself.

Along with unpaid time spent on tests and work samples and interviews, employers are increasingly adding the step of requiring an essay or answers a bunch of essay-style questions on the topic of why you want the job/why they should give it to you. The kinds of questions that could come up in an interview.  In my experience this comes before any interview or even a brief phone screen.  Sometimes it's required just to submit your application.

You can't just dash them off in 20 minutes either.  It's 5-20 in-depth questions asking for *detailed* info about specific stuff.  Plus if you want the job you want to write something halfway intelligent, so that will take longer.  You could easily spend several hours preparing your application.

**With no guarantee that any of it will ever be read.**

Sure, I can pop off a resume and cover letter.  If they're *actually interested* in me we can take it from there.  But this essay stuff is so unreasonable.  I figure jobseekers are putting in literally billions of unpaid hours a year on stuff like this.  Nothing stops employers from making their hiring process as onerous as they want, as long as some applicants are willing to do it.  any are!

 some supervisor made only me do the literal heavy-lifting for things that were also at a high place where I could barely reach filled with items of varying sizes, some which fell on me. She made me do it for like ten aisles, alone. I started on one aisle, and and then a coworker called me to two other aisles to work on. After I worked on those i returned (still having some of my energy left after all those heavy-lifting) to the initial aisle and the supervisor thought i hadn't budged from there and called me slow and ""speed up dude"" in her accent. I can understand questioning me to check why I was slow (i wasn't), but 

i thought if you were getting paid better, especially being at a higher-level with less work, you would be acting more professional, but no guess you just want to stroke your ego.

Later, I finished all my assignments, and was given an easier task. After I went to get other resources, i noticed my work-station was hijacked by others who have been working there for years. They also used up all the things I was using. Since it was still my first day, I didn't know where to look for it, and i went back to the usual place hoping someone filled it up again , though it was still empty. Suddenly the manager? sees me ask why I am doing nothing, although it was only 1 minute i stepped away from my work, after it got hijacked, to look for new work. I saw his face getting angry thinking that i wasn't slaving at all (more misunderstanding), which made me even angrier having this similar thing happen to me on the same (first-) day on i kept a stern face told him what I was doing, and he backed off somewhat . 

Was this a victory? NO! In the end I was still a slave, wasting my time (only minimum wage compensation), doing more and dangerous work, than my bosses, for my bosses to earn their pity and and be chewed upon by their misunderstanding.

 I mentioned they also want to stroke their egos. Well, this way, your ego will also be getting bigger along with the number of your enemies. I thought they enjoyed their ""'wonderful'"" career and life, so why do they make more enemies?

My colleague gets paid 8 hours of furlough pay per week, regardless of how much she actually works.

This means that she's worked 5 hours for free this week.

Similarly, I'm being paid regularly for some hours and furlough for others, so we worked out that I shouldn't be working any more than 5 hours extra, on top of my usual hours, per week.

It's just astonishing to me that a job will take free labor from you and dress it up as a present. I'm so glad that we checked for her sake - she's a single mum working 2 jobs and would be losing out on over £100 per month.

A job is supposed to be a means to an end, but capitalist indoctrination and my reflexive, constant comparison of myself to my old peers who weren't laid off from my old programming job makes me feel like I'm falling behind and stagnating, even when I'm doing my best to learn new things.

I've only been working 10 months but I've already learned so much about how dreadful the working world is. However, every now and then something will happen that really brings it all home.

I am an apprentice in the NHS. My apprenticeship is a dual one so I was supposed to spend half the year in Clinical Coding and half the year in archiving, but due to Covid and the fact the manager needed me more in Coding, I spent 8 months there. I really wanted to be a Clinical Coder, it's a fascinating job that suits my skill set and introverted personality. I applied for an opening in March and was told that, while my application was excellent, I just missed out on an interview. I felt this was fair enough as the job did require medical knowledge and while I felt I covered this well in the application, I was all too aware that anyone with a medical background would easily beat me out.

I moved to archiving in August and a couple of weeks ago another vacancy popped up (I should stress both vacancies were for two positions but were posted as one). I immediately applied and was more confident about my chances given that I had been working with patient case notes for a near constant and daily basis and had picked up more knowledge of anatomical terms, as well as a general knowledge of how patient case notes are structured. The other apprentice in the office also applied. She has been at the Trust for three months and is applying for everything, regardless of her level of interest.

Yesterday she was studying in the library for her apprenticeship and emailed me asking me about the fact that there is an anatomical test as part of the interview. I immediately checked my personal email and found that I had not been successful.

To say I was devastated is an understatement. I was fucking mortified, I have never felt quite so humiliated. A 20 year old who has 3 months of experience working at the Trust got an interview for a job in a department in which I had worked. My manager had made a comment to another high-ranking employee, who is lovely and supportive, that ""It was a shame I hadn't been at the Trust longer. I have been an employee there for 10 months and previous to that volunteered since July of last year.

I talked to the lovely employee and she had sent an email to the manager who claimed that my medical experience was lax. The other apprentice mentioned she had a GCSE in biology. I said the same and included the previous patient case note experience.

I worked my ass off in that department. I hated that job and constantly stressed about it, I threw up twice before work because of anxiety. I only worked so hard because I wanted to make a good impression and felt that I had. I used to sweat constantly because of the heavy physical element of the job and the stress of dealing with difficult, bitchy secretaries.

I always knew managers were shit but every now and then something happens that brings it home. This is an example of that. I know, I'm an idiot. I know, I'm naive. I wanted out of work since day one, but I really was foolish enough to think that my manager had a high enough opinion of me to not pull a bullshit stunt like this.

I have been with The Company for over 6 years now. In the meantime I had two pay increases, one of which was part of the promotion to a Senior position.

Before having my most recent annual review I opened a spreadsheet and did some math. I used take-home tax calculators separately for each year, I took the official government-published inflation numbers and calculated how much I am earning now in relation to 6 years ago. Even though the inflation has been rather mellow, one year even at zero, the final number was nearly -5%. To put it bluntly: If I was able to buy a 100 loafs of bread in 2014, today I can only buy 95 of them.

I have worked there for a long time, became an expert in the specific aspects of business, became well acquaintanced and liked by the customers, I have widely expanded my skillset. And in the end I earn less. I don’t think I need to say anything more to describe how ridiculously unfair and predatory that is.

I have raised it during my meeting and my position was, that “if you’re not paying AT LEAST 100% of what you agreed to when I was hired, I won’t be doing 100% of what I can.” Yeah, I even ignored the fact that the pay increases should push you higher in the purchasing power with each year, even if only slightly, and I asked to be paid at the same “living level” as previously. After all, inflation includes all: energy prices, food prices, all other necessities and amenities. And unless I became less productive, less valuable, then I should earn at least as much, right? And as mentioned above: I actually became better at what I do.

What was The Company’s response? “You are not giving your 100% so there cannot be talk about pay increase. You need to do MORE than 100%, and then we can reward that with higher salary”.

I tried to reiterate my point and even their point to show how ridiculous that statement is. In the end I was assured, that of course I am valuable and valued by the company. Just not in a monetary sense.

I’m awaiting actual pay increase announcement that should be coming not too long from now. I expect nothing and yet I’m sure I’ll still be disappointed.

Guys: do what I did. Don’t just eyeball stuff, as inflation compounds with each year, just like interest. Do some math and figure out how much more you’re actually earning vs previous years. You might end up surprised to find that you numerical increase actually doesn’t cover the rising costs of living…",[Rant] The negative pay rise mystery,18

Going back out into the world makes me want to barf. There was a time before I had a baby when I wanted to work and have a good job but all I experienced was how very competitive it seems to be to get any good job around here, abusive employers, getting my hours cut, not really getting paid enough for my education and experience, getting taken advantage of, not being able to support myself even though I’d be working like 2 jobs, etc. Working destroyed my self confidence and sometimes I just lay in bed at night thinking about the negative interactions I’ve had with people over the years or convincing myself people don’t like me, when really it’s probably since I was just working for some whack job. 

Even my stable government job I’m at now doesn’t give me health benefits, since they found a loophole to not give benefits. My boomer parents and in laws act like getting and having a job is easy, but that really has just never been my experience.",Just a long rant about returning to work after maternity leave,45

We could literally have people come in do their share of work producing/ maintaining machinery, crops transportation, healthcare and other necessities while takes a lot less time from them in return.

backstory- i struggled a lot  with depression ocd and sducidal thoughts since i was 15 and still going to earlier this year (i’m 19 now)
but the lockdown gave me time to just be free i had no work for a large period and i was just left alone with myself and i feel like i’ve really began to heal and recover 
i haven’t felt sducidal or depressed in a long time since this change in my life, i loved going the gym when i wanted i was there all the time or training up my local football pitch and spent my spare time learning stocks marketing and video editing, i’m big on exercise health and fitness i want to make that into a career with multiple streams of income ideally 
- but i am not getting the time to continue learning this 

i have had a new job for 2 weeks now because my parents pushed me to go full time and i just can’t cope i feel all progress i have made is slowly reversing i’m going back to bad habits, being very angry wanting to get high,eat bad foods and can’t be bothered exercising 
- all things i haven’t done in months and i’ve been very happy caring calm and loving toward myself and everyone around me .
i just don’t know what to do , money isn’t even a motivator i don’t want it i throw it all into savings but now having to go to an office job i had to buy new clothes as i had nothing “ appropriate “ to wear .


basically to sum up the past 2 weeks 
 it’s the feeling of being exhausted but so full of energy because i have done nothing but sit at a desk all day, 
I cant sleep because my physical body has hardly moved and isn’t tired meanwhile my mind is destroyed and begins to spiral 

how is this “living”?  
i  don’t want to be part of this society anymore 
why should i do something that kills me everyday so i can enjoy 2 days a week or better yet “ escape the 9-5 and book a nice holiday” 
why not just live a happy life why can no one around me see my point of view ??? if i don’t have a job i’m not respected but i could be working harder than the people who have a basic deadend j b and then in a few years time with the investment i have made into myself and as a person i know i’d be much better off !! 

and it’s not that i haven’t tried , i have woke up all week took the time to meditate , journal 
i have went for a run before and after work and i may feel good at some points throughout the day but i feel the exact same emptiness and hatred on myself every evening once i finish work and before going bed 
as i know what i’m doing to myself but i feel like i have no options cause no one around me willl understand

Businesses should be providing information on what they provide to their employees - wages, benefits, hours of operation, etc..

It is hilarious to see so many postings like this, with pages and pages detailing strict, thorough and complicated job details and what is expected without any compensation information - these posts are typically for minimum wage positions. It is sad, and disgusting.  Too much is expected for low pay and yet employers cannot even be bothered putting in proper compensation and benefits information, at the least.

Now we're trying to make more meaningless jobs, and taking value away from ""less desirable"" trades (like creative jobs), while people are staying in the workforce longer, so that as many people as possible can have a job to afford to survive.

People aren't given a choice anymore, and the jobs that are available are being paid less and less comparatively. Families and children are suffering because we don't live in a world were a family can be supported on a single income anymore. (No I am not saying women shouldn't work, I'm saying children develop better with either parent at home.)

I'm sure almost everyone would agree that they are more than willing to contribute, if they actually got to choose how they contributed, and if contributing didn't involve working under pressure, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, under the threat of not being able to eat or having a home to go home to.

The best thing we could do to fix the current system we have would be to essentially get rid of full time positions. 

Every employee gets the same benefits, and wages increase so you can make a living on part time work. Then you can hire more people to do the jobs that are currently available. 

You'd effectively end unemployment because there would be a surplus of jobs available, and the work life ballance would get much better because people would only be working 20-30 hours a week instead of 40-60. 

It's already been proven that people are less productive the longer their workday/week is. People get burnt-out. We aren't designed to be worker drones. 

So doing this would have less unemployment, more productivity, happier people as a whole, and more time and money to be put back into the economy. 

For those who are shortsighted, yes it would mean a significant number of businesses, small ones especially, would go out of business because of the change in financial responsibilities, but the ones that do fail wouldn't have been sustainable in the long run anyway, and we could implement short term government funding to businesses to help them transition, (cheaper than supporting everyone who is unemployed due to lack of available work indefinitely) they would also most likely shorten their hours to compensate initially, but supply and demand is still a thing, and we would see businesses reopen and expand hours again with the growing demand for it. The only difference is that now everyone is benefiting from it.

Unfortunately, i doubt we would ever see this happen because it would mean companies having to actually pay workers a reasonable wage and provide benefits to all of their employees.",I have an idea. (Bit of a rant),7

I do a job that I like and I did it as a hobby before, it is also the thing I studied. Money for the state of the work market are good but not something great. I would say that I can save 1 year's life expenses per 3 years I work and I live a simple life. So far, everything was great due to my wonderful and very good colleagues. There is some great solidarity between us.

However, after our first successes as a new department, the management went ape shit. They close deals right and left they expand into many unexplored areas for us with crazy deadlines. So far we struggled for those successes we had and we were getting better and better with baby steps, which was pretty sustainable. However now we are forced to make leaps to satisfy the new demands in crazy deadlines. On top of that when we first came we all did 1-2 projects in parallel now they want us to be in 3-4 projects that are way more demanding.

&amp;#x200B;

Their response on our complaints is that they will hire juniors for our less demanding projects. However the average juniors won't be able to pull their weight before a year and that depends on how much bullshit their project is. In fact the two juniors we had last year, one that was very competent lasted 10 months frustrated by management and the other that was hired because he knew a manager, tries hard but he is not competent after a year of working.  Now we have two new juniors that I doubt they will last as they work from home and they cant be benefited by the solidarity we have as a team. Plus they got on the last year of a collapsing 3-year project that was severely understaffed the first two years. I am at that project the last six months and 90% I did work that has to be redone because of bad management. I feel sorry for those dudes because they are entering at a world of pain.

I feel that management  clearly doesnt have a clue of our work and doesnt care at all. They just chase the money and they put the pressure on us. I dont believe they do an effort to organize the workplace they just dump tasks on random people that dont always have the right skills. It is anecdotal that sometimes people are working on tasks that dont match their skills while their colleagues a few feet further that have the skills for those tasks are working on stuff that they also dont have the skills. That is not sustainable. They will destroy the most successful team they have (their own words). At this point I dont care about getting fired so in contrast with my colleagues I have a lot of fights with management. My colleagues have warned me that the director has noticed and is not pleased. They try to protect me but frankly I dont give flying fuck anymore. The only thing I worry about is that me leaving, will put more pressure on the team.

I am in the tech and I wonder if this is a common phenomenon, or if it is just my workplace and my shithole country.  I feel like management doesnt give a fuck what we do or how difficult is what we do they just promise stuff and dump all the pressure on us.  It is funny that tottaly tech-incompetent people are shaping the projects that we have to implement and we are the incompetent ones if we cant meet their unrealistic expectations. Madness.

I’ve been browsing through this sub for a while and my God. The world is a terrible, terrible place. And why? Not because it has to be. Because of capitalists who will exploit anyone, anywhere at any time for an extra quid or two. The planet is literally on fire, a deadly virus is raging, people are unnecessarily dying, billions of innocent animals killed every year... do I need to go on? This world sucks. Capitalism sucks.

And I know things will could. But they might not. And even then, I don’t know if I care anymore. I’m exhausted. To put things bluntly, I’m becoming hollow on the inside. Even when I’m with friends, doing “what I like”, playing with my dog, other things that are meant to make me happy... deep down, it’s not enough. There’s a gaping hole in my soul and I feel too empty to change this shitshow of a world.

Besides. I’m one person. I’m not Lenin, not Marx, not Engels, etc. It’s not going to make much difference, no? Why did I have to be born in this timeline? I want to enjoy life, I want to be happy – but this isn’t the life nor the future I dreamed of. I can’t be happy when the world is in this state and that directly affects me and my freedom. I’m a slave, right? So I’m disposable and can be easily replaced.

So, why am I bothering? Even in school, despite being fifteen, we are meant to do quizzes for “jobs we might like”. What jobs? I am not sacrificing my being for the sake of some old white capitalist scum. As the years progress, I’m losing hope for this “revolution”. I see no revolution. In fact, all I see are a herd of ignorant neoliberals claiming that “voting” and “lesser evil-ism” will solve life’s wretched state.

I’m tired. I want to cry. I want to burn the world down to the ground. Then build an entirely new one using the ashes of the old and creating a society where people can know true happiness. But I can’t. I’d be like a martyr, but pointless. It’s suicide. I’ll get stuck in a 9-to-5. I’ll pay parasites that I hate. I’ll hate my job, boss and everything around me. I’ll become someone that I’ll hate and lose all hope.

I wonder if I should end things sometimes because it’s not my duty to fix this world. I did not create this mess, therefore I have no duty to tidy it. I’m likely detrimental to this cause, given my developing misery and uselessness. I’m writing this listening to “Office Life” and I wonder when I will feel happiness. The system does not want to modify what is genuinely causing depression and anxiety.

Instead, I am given pills and told to do some trivial activities like “positive thinking” and other nonsense. I’m going to end up as a commodity for the literal leeches of society. How is yoga or whatever meant to help? In fact, why am *I* trying so hard to fix this issue? I didn’t create the system that caused it. I want to burn that system down, in fact.

Quite a long rant, TL;DR at the end.

I work an office job for a big company. It's not atrocious but I clearly see a decline in the quality of the subjects I work on since last year.

I got upset today when my ""supervisor"" (he is not hierarchically above me but he basically controls the subjects I work on) told me that I would probably need to go alone on a business trip for 2 or 3 days next week in order to do something that's normally not my job.

I already went to this location a few weeks ago because I was one of the most relevant people to handle the work there was to do, so even though I don't like business trips (because I'm not more compensated despite having to dedicate my personal time to the company for a few consecutive days) I was not fundamentally against it. But this time, it's to do something that I'm not supposed to do, and that I barely know how to do. The reason I should go , I was told, is because ""we're short on resources"" (people). So, already knowing the answer, I naively asked ""But why don't we tell the management that we need more people ?"". The answer was ""We constantly told them for the past 3 years"". And obviously nothing changed for the past 3 years. So during all this time, the team had to do (and still has) with what they had in order to make the project succeed (or at least survive, I should say).

And that's exactly what the problem is: people in this team counterbalance the lack of resources by working late, doing more work than they should, and doing work they're not supposed / qualified to do. Not to mention the important amount of stress that they have to endure.

So of course the management does nothing to help: even though we tell them that there is a ""lack of resources"", the work is done, and that's all that matters to them. I think that the only way we could actually get more resources is by endangering the project itself, simply by doing our work as we are supposed to do instead of overworking. But that's not the team's mentality apparently. My teammates want to do more even though it might burn them out.

I always thought that this mentally was fucked up, so out of principle I try my best to never work too late or for too long. But this time, I feel like they might force me to do like them, even though I strongly informed my supervisor that I don't want to go and that I don't agree with the management policy. He didn't insist too much, but since the other people he asked refused to go too, I'm afraid he will come back to me and pressure me. 

I must confess that I am more and more fed up with this job that makes less sense to me every day, and I event recently considered to resign. I'm not quite sure yet if that would be such a good idea. But if my supervisor insists too much, I'll inform him that I'm considering quitting this job. If he forces me, I'll quit.

I'm not against discovering new things, new places, or learning things that I don't know yet. But I don't want to be forced to do things I never asked and that I am not supposed to do, and sacrificing myself and my family for the sole reason that the company's management is utter bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My supervisor wants me to go on a business trip for a few days in order to do something that I am not supposed to do, that I don't want to do, and that I barely know how to do, because our management doesn't want to give us more resources and it's a habit of this team to overwork themselves.",Just another rant about sacrificing your employees for your managerial mistakes / greed,9

Around 12 months ago the corporate giant that owns my company got caught in a massive employee underpayment scandal. To the tune of $500 million and counting. Turned out they weren't paying government mandated allowances and penalties. 

As a result they tucked their tails and said 'we'll pay it all back plus interest, but give us time to investigate' 

So then corona hit and we were all scrambling. As I'm sure a lot of you were...whats the story? Do I come in on Monday? The premier just said there's a fucking a curfew?.. So liquor is an essential service now? OK fuck you I guess I'm coming in. 

As a thank you for working during a pandemic they gave non-salary staff stock options and a $250 gift card. Salary staff at a sister company owned by the same corporation got a $1000 bonus in march or April. 

We got nothing.  

It's been as busy as Christmas since march. What can people do in a lockdown but drink and beat their wives? Sales are higher than ever but roster budget continues to get slashed. 

If a shop pays penalty rates due to OT they get a please explain from upstairs. 

And still no word on our back pay and not so much as a thank you for working during a pandemic... Just a bunch of empty platitudes about family and teamwork and keep up the good work. Great numbers today, atta boy!! 

Seriously since march, humans have become fucked. So entitled, so abusive to those that have to serve them. Working retail the last six months has honestly  been horrific. I'm forced to get into altercations on a nearly daily basis. I cringe when I get called to the front becuase it's just as likely something basic or me having to get into another fight with some fuck

It's really demoralising having to put yourself through that AND know the company is underpaying you. 

No word on the underpayment investigation...Until about 6 weeks ago. 

We just finished working out the back pay situation and based on our calculations we owe you nothing.

But wait. 

They are going to 'lock in' our performance bonus to 80% as a thank you for working in a pandemic.... Not even the whole fucking thing. When I know for a fact this was the most profitable 6 months in the companies history. What a slap in a face. 

But wait. 

We now want our salaried staff to cover Saturdays and Sundays so we can save about $200 on Sunday pay per store. End result you are working a 4 week roster that results in you working 15 out of 17 days before a propper break... You don't need to spend time with your friends and family. We need you here on Sunday! 

And... 

Let's agree you don't necessarily need compensation for things like public holidays and overtime and meal allowances so we don't run into that pesky underpayment situation again. 

Also. 

Let's get all that on paper and bully you to sign it while unemployment is at an all time high so you have no where to go.

Yep they forced a contact change during a fucking pandemic. 

It was made clear to me that if I refused to sign HR would be involved right away and it would not be comfortable. 

What makes me most mad though is the conference calls, where these compassionless arseholes are broadcasting from their couch or kitchen or in the backyard having a beer and a BBQ giving me all the 'we're all in this together' bullshit. 

We ain't in shit until you're here on a Sunday handling some old geezers slobber covered cash motherfucker... Seriously I've seen boomers take their mask off to lick their finger to pull the cash out to hand over. Un fucking believable.

But how if that good career never exists?? I see the people in so-called good jobs around me getting laid off anyway during pandemic. Or being forced to work defying all the health risks. 

I don’t want to work like a horse for the rest of my life just to be able to have a decent life. I don’t want a big mansion nor a sport car, just the freedom to relax in a piece of land I can call mine while drinking wine and not worry about money.

Is that even too much to ask? 

People around me are just saying that I should be grateful that I can find a job, etc but that’s bollocks.

Fuck this. Whatever this game called life is, I am quitting.","Young, middle class and a 3rd world country resident: Rant",16

I graduated Nursing School at around 20. To be completely honest, I had no choice of whatever profession I can take since it’s either be medical or go to law or accountancy. And my Asian parents were just pushing me to earn money fast even when I was barely an adult. Honestly having Asian parents suck, I wouldn’t recommend it. Such a toxic ‘you have to be better than Mr. B’s daughters’ and ‘pride over stupid material things and status culture. Probably one of the main reasons why I hated working in the first place. 

I moved alone and lived in Brighton for a bit and met friends there and a lot of them folks my age, are just living their lives the way they want to. (Although some of them have illegal part time jobs) They were still HAPPY and do not give any fcks about whatever people think of em.

For a while though, it felt like I was hanging out with losers cause the more I spend time with them the more I realised these people have no direction in life. Leeching off the system. Pretending to be disabled and putting each other as their designated carers or whatever to get free housing and benefits.

I hate working but I don’t want to be a fcking parasite.

I also lived in London and every single day when you take a commute in the morning, I swear you’re in a train full of dead zombies. It made me so depressed. And the busyness of it all made me anxiety worse. Hence why I moved again and moved back to the countryside.

After moving for the nth time and not enjoying the nth hospital / company I applied to. Not enjoying the toxic medical environment, not enjoying the commute. Not feeling any satisfaction or any gratefulness of ‘helping people’. Isn’t my job supposed to be rewarding? 
It is for a tiny bit then again is it worth giving all of me, my time to people who won’t even remember my name the next day. Families who won’t even remember the NURSE who did everything (run around, get the meds, inject the meds) to save their family member. They will remember Dr. Smith though.

COVID-19 happened and things got more shttier. 

No one has any idea how to handle things. Everything that we’ve doing at the hospital before were all apparently non effective and could not protect us from this disease. 

They change the policies every single day and I’m not even sure if it’s to PROTECT us, the public or their pockets.

Beginning of last week, they told us not to use excessive PPE anymore because Public Health England says so. And using minimal PPE is enough.

All of this nightmare, is getting to me. I’ve been working so much over the last few months.

I’ve been working 50+ hours and even weekends.

Last Wednesday, my alarm didn’t go off because my phone didn’t charged and it was dead.

I was so anxious and didn’t know what to do. I live about an hour away from work and will be super late if I even attempt to go.

I decided I would just lie and call off sick.

I couldn’t think of any excuse but say I have a fever and I told them that and then they all panicked cause I forgot it’s a COVID symptom and now I have to self isolate for 10 days, take a test and the whole shebang.

I took a test, obviously it’s negative. But my manager said I can come back to work if it’s negative and I feel better. 

I received my test yesterday and I still haven’t reported it to my manager yet cause I still don’t want to go back. 

I probably would let them know later and come back to work tomorrow. It would be months and months of overtime and not being able to sit down again. 

I hate it though. I’m glad I saw this thread. And know that I am not alone. I’m waiting for a few more months, save some money and do part time. But it might not actually happen as soon as I want to cause my bf is at risk of losing his job , we need to pay the rent and we have two cats we need to feed. But I honestly cannot wait to quit work forever.

At the time I was working part time in an off-price retail store. The money wasn’t great but the hours were flexible around my uni schedule and I didn’t mind the work. I already had in mind that I wanted to do a PhD so before I quit the store, I did the bulk of writing out a huge proposal on my days off. 

I decided that the retail job has nothing more to offer me, so I decide I just want a temporary full time job (not working weekends for once) doing something easier, to earn some cash to pay some debts off, then maybe work on my PhD applications a little more, maybe do some travelling. 

I find a job in a call centre. It’s temp to perm, so not quite what I had in mind but the recruiter tells me, just do the 12 weeks and if you don’t want to stay on permanently, you can leave. 

Then COVID happened. I’ve been there for 7 months. I know I should be lucky that I had a job over lockdown but it’s hard to be pleased about such an awful job. 

I still haven’t been made a permanent member of staff. If I’m a minute late logging into my computer, I get a late form and have to make it up at lunch. Every day we get emails reprimanding is for something or other, like we’re in school. The clients that we work for at the call centre are extremely unethical, scamming confused old ladies. They’ve been understaffed for a long time so the work load has been insane. We are VERY closely monitored. I just hate my life being so controlled and micromanaged. 

I mentally checked out of the job a long time ago. I’ve been on sick leave for 3 weeks now and I’m due to go back in on Monday and I’m terrified. The thought of the job makes me sick to my stomach. I’ve tried applying for jobs and also getting back into my PhD applications, but I’ve been stressing about finding a job ASAP before my leave was over, so it’s made things even worse. Once I’m back, it will be impossible to apply for new jobs or a PhD course as both are essentially full time jobs, and I’ll never get the time off to go for interviews. 

I love being in education and focusing on my own projects. I HATE this super controlled 9-5 life. 

I live with my parents so I won’t be homeless or foodless if I leave and my parents agree that I should quit if I need to. My mother actually worked at this company years ago, and had to quit due to the strain on her mental health, so they understand completely. However, the idea of having no income scares me to bits. I have a little bit of money to cover my bills but not much. I’m planning on going back next week, handing my notice in on Friday and working my notice so I can at least have two weeks extra plus my holiday hours to add to my funds. 

I can’t believe I’ve gotten myself into this mess and I don’t know how to get out. I should never have left my retail job. I am also having a quarter life crisis, I’m 25 and nowhere near my goals. I hate that my entire life has to focus around working and earning money.

These shifts aren’t necessarily horrible. I’ve done ‘clopens’ before where you work 2pm-10 and then come in the next day at 5am, but the 2pm-10 one day and the 8am-4 the next day is one of the stupidest things. At least with the clopens I know I’m getting fucked. I know when I get home from clopens I KNOW I won’t get my 8 hours so I can take my time doing my home duties.

These 2pm-10 and 8am-4 give me just enough time to get home, cook, eat, water my plants, brush my teeth and immediately go to sleep.

I have to speed run my few precious hours off of work in order to get the basic home chores before going to bed because my manager doesn’t know how to make a decent schedule. 

But even if I do get in bed at record time, I start to think, “with the current 16 hours of work, I only have 2 hours of FREE time.” And I spend the next 3 hours tossing in turning in anger because how fucked I’m getting. 

But then I realized, I can call out. So I did. I get a strike and if I do it another two times I’ll get a write up, but I’m okay with that. I think I might call out again tomorrow for shits. This job has controlled my life more than the virus has and it feels good to just do what *I want for once.*

So my dad died in April when I was on leave of absence. His body had decomposed so none of my siblings or I could see him one last time. Someone anonymous paid for his cremation. And we didn’t even THINK about a service because we didn’t have the money for cremation either. I genuinely thought my dad would be donated to science or put in an unmarked grave. 

Anyway... I know they knew I asked off. Because I asked off for my birthday at the end of July. And I asked off for 31st/1st. And I told them it was to spread my dad’s ashes in my home state with my siblings. He had the shittiest life, and I just want to do something nice for him and have closure for us. I picked the 31st because it was the date that my dad and nana were in a wreck, and my nana passed. It’s the ten year anniversary of that, and I wanted to free my dad from that day that just ruined him.

She was also like “oh yeah, make sure to get some people’s number for next time you call out because it’s your responsibility to cover your shift”. LMFAO, I just said “okay”. And walked off. 

Not to mention I was piping hot pissed my entire shift today. There was no online schedule, so I looked at the paper when I got there and I was scheduled. I even started tearing up. My general manager even tried pulling, “she probably couldn’t find anyone else to cover your shift”. Okay? I don’t fucking care.

I’m tired of people talking down to me just because I’m the lowest on the totem pole position wise. I can’t take being a punching bag anymore. 

Long rant incoming, because I haven’t really had a chance to vent to anyone at all yet. 

I’ve been working from home since March due to COVID. I have a sedentary office job where I’m on the phone and typing at a computer for 8.5 hours a day (I work 9 hours 4 days a week in exchange for a half day off on Fridays). I won’t get super detailed as to what I do but basically I manage short term disability claims for people. You get sick, you can’t work, so you file for disability through a third party company that manages the benefit for your employer. I’m with the third party. 

So I work with people in my company, the customer (employer) and claimant (employee, or you). Obviously when speaking with a wide variety of people, I encounter assholes all the time. But really gets me is the way people in my OWN company talk to me. I want to put a disclaimer that my direct manager and the other people on my team are actually all great. 

So several weeks ago I agreed to do a weekly call with one customer we have. Every Wednesday at 10 am they send a spreadsheet of claims they have questions about. I go through their list and type answers next to their questions on their spreadsheet. Then from 12-1 we have a call where we go over said answers. It drives my manager crazy that we have to read a spreadsheet aloud to other grown ass adults but it is what it is I guess. 

So for the past several meetings I was just sitting in on the call not really doing anything, while I listened to my coworker (whom I’m replacing for this as she’s gotten promoted). It’s pretty easy to get the gist of how to do the call. You literally just answer the questions at the meeting. And type the questions on the spreadsheet before the meeting. Boom. 

So last Wednesday (08/12) was my first meeting with them all on my own. It was just me, the two reps from the customer, and the account manager with my company. They kept asking me what was going on with one of my coworkers since he hadn’t been responding to their emails, and some of the things they were mentioning on the call that week were actually brought up the prior week, so he still hadn’t done what they wanted. I said, “I think he’s just a bit behind, I’ll go ahead and send him another email to get it done by EOB today.” And then we moved on. 

A week later, this past Wednesday, I log in that morning to some emails forwarded to me by my manager, asking for my input. The account manager that had joined the call basically went over my and my managers heads straight to the directors complaining about the way I did the meeting. She said I “alarmed the customer” by telling them “the entire team was behind” and she was concerned about how I “incorrectly completed the spreadsheet.” The customer is apparently now on “thin ice” with us and she was blaming me for the customer now having a poor opinion of us. The whole (long) email was written in an incredibly condescending way and basically made me sound like an incompetent fool. It was humiliating because she had cc’d a bunch of higher ups in my department as well as my manager. 

I called my manager after cooling off a bit from reading this email and explained everything. I said I did not tell them the whole team was behind, I said my one coworker was behind, and I filled the spreadsheet out exactly how I was taught. She agreed with me and said she had already had a meeting that morning with the directors where she defended me. She reviewed said spreadsheet and compared it with one she did and they were identical. She said she isn’t sure why the customer freaked out that i said my coworker is behind because a.) we’re all human, and working under double the normal caseload, and b.) she had already spoken with them a few days prior and TOLD them he was behind. So they already knew. She assured me I wasn’t in trouble but it would take a lot of meetings and some time to make this all blow over. 

I told her that effective immediately I wouldn’t do the calls anymore. I was not going to spend two hours of my already extremely busy day being belittled by these people over a stupid fucking spreadsheet. She agreed to take me off for at least a few weeks and she would do them. 

I’m upset because this is NOT the first time someone at the company has taken something I said and twisted it around and blew it out of proportion and complained about me being “unprofessional.” This happens a couple times a month maybe? I’m so sick and tired of tiptoeing around everyone because of this stupid office culture. I know I didn’t do anything wrong, but what I can’t stand is just the WAY people talk to others. I’m going crazy with these passive aggressive pissy emails that people keep sending me about dumb shit that doesn’t even matter. I hate how empty my life is, that it just revolves around incessantly pleasing others, and filling out spreadsheets, and trying to keep control of my customer service voice while the person on the phone screams and yells at me that I’m stupid and pointless. Then I get two days away from it to feel dread about the other five days a week, just to do it all over again week after week after week as life passes me by. If this is going to be the rest of my life then I don’t want to hang around to see it. I’m 24 and have 40 years left of this. I have no hope and almost no happiness, just evenings filled with Netflix and Instagram by myself on the couch, maybe a few weekends every few months I get to do something fun. I’m not actively suicidal but if I was to drop dead tomorrow I wouldn’t be sad about it. I’d probably be better off.",I’ve logged off at the end of the day in tears several times this week - rant,15

For a long time I thought I was the only person who felt this way. I was surrounded by people hungry for more work, who identified with their careers or were aggressively competitive to achieve goals I just couldn't understand (ie: become next second assistant manager of Corporation X etc). I thought it was all bunkum but I never expressed it, I was too afraid of being marked out as weird/lazy/socialist/freeloader. Even now, although I have revealed my thoughts and feelings about work to one or two people, I'm still pretty careful about what I say. Career Culture is strong. But here, even the very idea of no work at all ever again is celebrated (such an extremist idea from where I've come from) :) so thank you.

At the moment I am currently working full-time in marketing for a non-profit. I am on medical leave for about a week and a half for work-related stress and anxiety. Right now, I feel so much calmer and settled. I will be seeing a psychologist in a few weeks to sort of a number of issues, but I've often wondered would it be even necessary if I never had to work again or at least, work far less hours? I've also wondered if a lot of mental health issues around the world could easily be resolved with less or even no work? 

I think the thing that irks me the most about most of the jobs I've ever had... is the inanity and lack of purpose or point behind them. Oh sure there is a ""point"" to it - paycheck! But any other meaning it had was to me so abstract, so removed from reality it often made me question why we did such activities. An example would be formatting fancy pants documentation for government consumption, but knowing these would be rarely read, almost never adhered to and would end up at the bottom of some bureaucrat's dusty paper stack. It was just to ensure another box was ticked. At my current position, I hardly see the connection between what I do and the workplace's goals. Or that even my work contributes at all to benefit our non-profit's recipients. 

On top of all that, there are the endless meetings where nothing of true value is discussed or concluded upon, the managing of personalities and politics, the cringy team building activities that were created in order to force build friendships between people. All this ""cream and cherries on top"" just adds to the sheer inanity of my current job. It seems to be IMHO that most modern day work is ultimately empty and has no intrinsic value besides ensuring people have a paycheck to keep them from being homeless.

Over time as I dealt with this, I have become more and more despondent. As of late, I have reached a point where I questioned even the point of existing, if all it was... was endless, pointless work? The fact that we trade up finite precious time to do empty meaningless work just to survive? It is as if our lives our marked with a monetary value and we are reduced down to just economic input/output units. It was this entrapment and dehumanization that spurred my despair and anger into life. We are given enough to not drown (sometimes not even then), but never enough to clamber onto the shore. 

I tried to manage this growing despair and sense of meaningless, so I did the usual; journal, exercise, attempt to establish some sleeping pattern (didn't really work), talk it out with friends and family (but I couldn't really express just how deep my hopelessness went), I applied for new jobs (part-time roles, but in this day and age, jobs are hard to come by and every job has a hundred applicants or more), I attempted to upskill (hard to do on an FT position, just too tired to do anything), tried to consider employment through different perspectives and of course, browsing r/antiwork

At best, some of these methods mitigated my despair and constant questioning, but eventually that sense of hopelessness, overwhelm and meaningless came to colour my whole world. I would attend work each day, my stomach roiling and my heart hammering, dreading the day ahead. As of late, I went to the doctor, expressed what was going on in regards to my mental health, and she was sympathetic towards me - which was surprising. We organized some medical leave, counselling and anti-depressants. The anti-depressants are what helped me work full time once upon a time. I decided to go off them earlier this year due to feeling extremely flat and emotionless about most things in my life. It turns out zombifying your brain is how one is able to cope with FT work. I have a little bit of hope back regardless of this. 

I'm not sure what I'll do next, I'll enjoy my time off as much as I can but after that...Idk. I'm sorry for the long post, I feel that there is nowhere or no one else I can truly express the depths of my thoughts or feelings on this topic. So thank you for reading if you have gotten this far.

Me, being a guy in my upper 20s, really couldn’t care less of most social/political issues. I like science and technology and my stance is I’m an idiot and think the professionals in their fields should be the people we turn to. I keep my head down and work, but this conversation got to me. 

The stimulus checks and unemployment during COVID came up. I’ll paraphrase and spare you their ridiculous rhetoric. They were bagging on people not working (up to 40% of Americans due to no fault of their own) saying that they don’t deserve money if they don’t work. The unemployment checks also are too much, they need to look for other jobs, blah blah blah. 

Here is where I had to step in. One person says, “I don’t understand why people would think it’s ever ok to not work. They expect to be able to have food and a home and do whatever they want. What kind of purpose would someone like that serve? I had to work my ass off to make it. You need to work hard to be able to survive.” 

“Okay, here we go,” I stepped in. “Let’s dissect this topic a little. First, yesterday you were talking about how you are retiring early because you don’t want to work and want to live and do whatever you want. All of us here are working so one day we won’t have to. I would much rather do my hobbies everyday than sit at this desk, wouldn’t you?”

“Well, yeah. But that’s why I’m working.” 

“Okay but it’s fair to say you wouldn’t work if you could maintain your income? Or at least a reasonable, livable income. Keeping in mind the average worker in 2020 is make wages much less than others in the past century, taking cost and inflation adjustments into consideration.”

“Yeah I guess I would.” 

“Well alright then, but let’s dig further. You have children. I can almost guarantee you have told them something like ‘I work hard so you won’t have to’ or ‘make the world better for you.’ So what’s the point if we leave things worse than before? Eventually, things will reach a point where most jobs will be automated. After, computers will be able to create and think using AI. If they don’t kill us, everything will likely be out of the hands of humans. Think of every ‘perfect’ society in science fiction or futuristic movies. The Utopian existence is nothing but people doing what they want. Creating, building, having fun. The ultimate goal is making a world where we don’t work. Meanwhile, we created this construct that demonizes people who exist outside the norm of structured capitalism even though most do no harm and just exist happily. All the while we work to achieve almost exactly what they are doing.” 

After this massive word vomit, they either agreed reluctantly of just wanted me to shut up so they went back to their desks to work. 

This whole, “you need to work to be important” facade needs to stop. Let’s stop pretending what we are doing isn’t made up and unnatural.

Fuck working for other people. A coworker I had was technically a contracted part-timer. Contracted bc she works for a property manager (who themself is a contracted employee) and part time because early this year, the TWO property managers who were splitting coworker's pay (which came out to about 8 or 9 an hour- bullshit in and of itself!) stopped getting along and made her choose between them suddenly. Coworker had two days to choose. I told her back then, fuck that noise, start filling out resumes. 

Instead, she chose one of them (path of least resistance) and took the reduced workload (meaning, you know, being assistant to one whole person) and reduced pay - even though it's impossible to work part time as a property management assistant bc she has no real ""set"" hours. It's like being on call all day but only getting paid for what was done, but you can't have another PT job bc you have to be available. I explained to her that it was a monopoly of her time, and to ask for a raise and start looking for full-time work.

But people are so conditioned to not speak up to employers, to be so GRATEFUL for work. I hate this culture.

So, yesterday. Her employer calls her in for a meeting, hands her a check, and tells her that it's her last day. 
That she can't afford to keep her on.
That it was such a hard decision.
That she struggled for MONTHS with this decision.

The. Fuck.

Coworker was given a box and told to clear out her desk. That day.

Mind you, any time during the last two months, coworker could have gotten the extra 600/WK, a shit-ton more than she's paid now. The CARES act ends fucking tomorrow. Her husband already works. They just bought a house. Her dad has expensive medical bills every month. 

And her employer ""struggled for MONTHS with this decision."" And decided the best way to end her struggle was to put Coworker out without notice.

Fuck working for other people. Fuck property management, I feel like I'm turning knobs on the Death Star. Fuck ""it was a tough decision but we're still friends""-ass people firing employees during a pandemic with NO warning AFTER the most beneficial benefits are up. Even a ""hey things are tight, if they don't get better I'm going to have to let you go next month"". That's what a human fucking being does.

We're just like any other business, we provide a service. For the most part I liked this job, easy work, decent pay, it had the occasional office politics which I stayed out of, most of the time I came in, did my 9-5, and left. Easy as that. 

The thing I enjoyed most was working with my customers (or as we're supposed to call them, clients). I was responsible for bringing in new clients and getting them into our system. With phones ringing all day, we were supposed to bring in 80-100 calls EACH per day, with no call going over 5-10 minutes. The service we provide can range from $100-$500 PER YEAR. Now look, if I'm paying as much as $500 per year on anything, I want the full rundown. I want to know what I'm paying for, what that gives me, everything, I'd want every single detail. As did every single client that called in. The issue is you can't do that in 5-10 minutes, and it always leads to clients calling back unhappy, confused, or simply wanting to cancel.

Me, I did everything I could for my clients, I'd answer everything question, concern, anything and everything. Wasn't good enough for my boss as my calls lasted anywhere from 20-30 minutes, cause guess what? I cared about these people, and they deserve a good damn service if it's up to $500 a year. So I was only doing maybe 30-40 calls a day versus the 80-100 we're supposed to do.

Now you could say yeah, you only got half the clients you we're supposed to get. The thing is we have a satisfaction grade every week. The average you're supposed to have is around 85%. Now I don't mean to blow my own horn here, but I was bringing in an average of 92-95% for weeks. I felt like I was hitting home runs every week till this morning.

I get the call this morning saying I'm being let go for poor performance, as I'm not taking a correct number of calls a day, and it's been an ""issue"" for a while. I realized today that even customers are just $ signs to CEOs and your boss. Funny thing is my wages have stayed the same since I started, while my supervisor and boss always go on about their bonus checks and raises. My satisfaction grade meant nothing this entire time, all it meant was I'm bringing in half the pay for my boss.....

I'll miss my clients and I feel for them as I feel only a few of us actually cared for them, and focused on them versus focusing on the number of calls. Corporations don't care about their employees, and I now realize they don't give two shits about their customers either....

TLDR: Got fired today for spending too much time helping customers with their service",I got fired from my office job this morning. It made me realize corporations treat customers the same way they treat employees. (Long Rant),117

Apologies in advance if this is the case and point me to where I need to go

&amp;#x200B;

Like it says in the title this is about co-workers (one in particular in my case)  who look down on or outright deride your hobbies or interests outside of work.

So this person, I'll refer to him as RG (retail guy) fucking LOVES retail. It's almost all the talks about and it seems to be a huge part if not all of his identity as a person. Now I admit I could be wrong and there could be a lot more to him I've worked with RG for a little over a year and he talks A LOT. And if someone talks enough you can usually formulate a fairly accurate picture of what they're about.  There's more (quite a bit in fact) I could say about him but that's the essence of it.

&amp;#x200B;

So one of my main hobbies is BJJ (Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu), I love it! I've never taken to just ""going to the gym"" because I have quite an active mind and invariably get distracted or bored but with BJJ (as those who've done it will know) gives both your body and mind a workout. Nothing clears my mind like a good BJJ session.

Around last august I hurt my knee training, it wasn't too serious, just hurt like a sonofabitch and I had a fairly noticeable limp for about 3 weeks. I could still work albeit not at the same pace. He asks me how I hurt my knee and I tell him, and he responds with ""sounds like the kind of thing you do to get unhealthy"" (let's ignore the fact that unhealthy and injured are two different things shall we?). And follows up with an attempt at a guilt trip, saying I'd be letting the store down ***IF*** I hurt myself so it was that I couldn't work. ***IF*** being the operative word here folks. (just a quick aside this guy is big on reminding you of hypotheticals, he's often told me off saying IF we were at another company you'd be in big trouble for that, etc, cue internal eyeroll)

What got me was that this wasn't in the least motivated about my personal safety but that our boss might make less money (our boss is actually a pretty nice guy, he owns the premises our shop is on so he's not uber concerned with squeezing every last drop of profit out, this guy, however, IS). Let's set aside for a moment the fundamentally dehumanizing core of his message, it was more that he heavily implied I should stop doing something I enjoy to concentrate more on work. (I actually went on Amazon and bought another gi within 15 minutes of that conversation so I could rotate them and train more)

&amp;#x200B;

Another incident happened while I was reading on my break, now I always take my full allotment of break time (even when we're not busy at all and people take an extra 5 minutes here or there he always takes shorter breaks ). He's on his break as well and asks me what I'm reading, I reply that I'm reading a sci-fi novel. He has this perplexed look on his face and says ""what're you reading that for?"", now this was asked more curiously than anything but again I got the vibe that he thought because it wasn't work-related it wasn't worth any time.  While there wasn't derision implied here it was still indicative of this work-centric attitude that I not only find quite disturbing but also somewhat wasteful. We've got a limited time on this planet and with a world full of music, art, science, etc this guy has chosen work as his passion.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it sounds like a rant about one particular co-worker and in a lot of ways, it is but when I ran into this attitude at my previous job because it was a larger company I was able to put more distance between myself and the person in question. My current job, however, is much smaller both in terms of physical space and staff so it's much harder to avoid people and that has brought this attitude front and center in my consciousness.

So after quite a lot of backstory and context, we get to the crux of why I posted this today. I want to hear/discuss you guys &amp; gals similar experiences of people denigrating, disregarding or outright criticizing your hobbies outside of work or even having a healthy life-work balance (weighted more towards life of course).

So yeah, really looking forward to hearing from you guys &amp; gals, I know it might sound like a somewhat grim topic to discuss but this rant was very cathartic for me and I already feel a little better!

Hi everyone, please bear with me as this is my first post on this sub, although I've been a lurker for well over a year. I agree so much with much of the sentiment on this subreddit. Honestly, finding this sub was such a massive relief for me. I spent years wondering if there was something fundamentally wrong with me for just having no passion whatsoever for our modern way of life. Please bear with me, as I have a lot of thoughts and I struggle with keeping them organized, but I need to get this out before it kills me.

I am someone who feels like I am just not cut out for this world. I don't necessarily mean in the sense that I have a mental illness, although I do.  I mean in the sense that I just simply do not have the skills or mentality to thrive in life. I am at this point in time 34 years old. I have nothing. I mean that in the sense that I have no (marketable aka ""useful"") skills at all, as well as a complete lack of material assets. I do not have my own place, nor can I even imagine ever getting to the point of being able to afford one. I have tried many times in the past to live on my own, only to come crawling back home in a matter of months each time. Now, I live with a relative and pay rent. I have a bedroom to myself. Everything I own is in this one single room. It doesn't amount to more than a few hundred dollars' worth of stuff.  I don't have a car. I've never had one and I have no hope of ever affording one, even though it's kind of a moot point since I never got my license. I got my permit at 17, but a series of very dangerous driving lessons and a seriously scary wreck at 19 left me with a terrible phobia of driving. I will never get over that.  Unfortunately as well, where I live has virtually no public transportation ( there's a sort of bus system, but in addition to being costly, you have to call ahead 24 hours and schedule a pick up. It's really laughable).  I have a small collection of clothing that is all over a decade old. I have to wear them until they fall apart and then some time after, if I can't save up a month in advance ( I am not joking in the slightest).  I work a retail job that is absolutely killing my spirit.  I make less than $400 a month, almost all of which goes to rent, the rest to my insurance so I can afford my antidepressants. Without them, my thoughts become dangerously dark. Basically, I work to keep myself medicated and supplied with nicotine because I can't function otherwise.  

This job is horrible. But it's the best I've been able to find in the last five years, and in my area, it's the best you're going to get. I want to get out of retail, desperately. I have tried and tried, and yet I just can't get out. My limited skills could be transferred to an office setting. In fact, I worked in hospitals for a number of years, both in purchasing and medical records. But I can't get anything close to that now. I feel trapped, and the fact that my current job is doing nothing to protect myself and my coworkers from COVID is not helping.  I thought I had a fever last week and my managers reacted to my not wanting to go into work sick as a major inconvenience (which yes, I expected, but come on. I was sick and scared). Luckily (haha), it was just my body reacting to prolonged stress (it's made me sick like this before).  

I'm writing all this because every day that I have to leave my home and go out into the world, I see more and more how utterly cold and hateful people have become, often for no reason, even more often as a consequence of my employment. People will then say, ""Go to school"". Okay, NO. Why no? Because I went. I went right out of high school because my mother demanded it of me. I had no clue what I wanted or why I was there. She just kept saying I would figure it out. It took me ten years to pay off my student loans for one year of school. And I still have no idea what I would do if I went back. Why would I go right back into that situation that left me in debt right out of the gate??? What sense does that make??? Am I crazy for not seeing something that must be so obvious to everyone else apparently? 

I have no interest in starting a business either. I have never been competitive in nature and honestly... What would I have to offer? Nothing! So instead, I just keep going to work, being forced to seem happy to serve and ecstatic for the chance to die for capitalism because surprise, no one cares if they get their cashier sick, because we're not even people.  I see no joy in doing this day after day for the rest of my life, because, obviously retirement is laughably out of the question. I cannot do it. If someone were to ask me what my plans are in life, I have none whatsoever. I don't want anything. I am burned out. I don't bother with my hobbies anymore because they make me so tired. My only goal is to keep going until I decide I don't want to do it anymore, and then I'm going to stop entirely. I don't care about myself or this life anymore. I'm just done.

I don't know where I was going with this anymore but thanks of you've hung around until the end. I just needed to get this out without someone trying to shut me up or guilt me for having these feelings. I just see how pointless it all is and especially for me, I have nothing to offer that would improve the condition for humankind in any way. I may be good at some things, but not \*enough\* to actually do any good in the long run. I just don't know why I'm here, and why I should want to stay to keep doing all this every day until I drop dead.  I guess that's all I have to say for now, except for how grateful I am that this place exists.",Am I Supposed to be Enjoying this??? (Long Rant),45

It was working at a farm doing packaging stuff. At like 20 I called my mom sobbing because I was working a job that was ""ruining my life"" not because it was particularly bad, but because it took all my time and I was a young person trying to be free in the world and I was already trapped in this horrible cycle of work to live, live to work. But she didn't get it, and I felt so ashamed for being weak that I blame my depression and anxiety on other things so that people would understand.
I just feel like, how did we all accept that working is what makes you a valuable human being and if you don't do it then you are not worth shit? It's horrible. And the thing is, if working wasn't absolutely required, I'd definitely do some of it anyways, just to help society. I'd gladly do it. But the way we have like limited what kind of jobs each person does means that everything is outsourced and each person is relegated to one form of contribution and I think it just ruins all our humanity and all our community/potential connections. Because when someone needs my help or something if I'm already working 40 hours a week, I'm way more likely to say ""that's not my job."" 
Anytime I've criticized working culture in my life people have made fun of me like I'm stupid and just don't understand economics. Which is partly true, I don't understand economics (it was because I was like what is job creation, if there is a job to be done, shouldn't it already be there? Why are we creating it). But I know that humans are miserable and that should matter. 
I also think the people at the top are miserable, because they've bought in with their very lives and energy and time into this system that makes us all relate to one another in terms of money and production value. They're just rich enough to not be outwardly miserable, but I think this shit erodes your spirit and your ability to connect with other people.  
There has to be a different way to live.
And, I hate that being part of the working class takes away your ability to explore art and ideas and have a forum to like discuss them and be seen and heard about your ideas about the world. You can still do these things obviously by yourself, but it just feels like there is no one who gives a shit about my feelings because if my feelings were correct I would have ascended the magical structure already. Like why do we care about celebrities thoughts on things they have no background in? Just because they are rich and famous we should listen to what they think about dieting, or about education, or child care, etc?  
This has been a rant, but I was really relieved to find some people who think that the concept of working your life away for someone else is crazy. Thanks for existing.","Can't believe there's other people who think this stuff about work , I thought I was alone (rant)",147

I lived most of my life in a small city near the coast and the farmside and with a good standard of living, but since my dad got a new job in a big city in the south of the country we moved to this city, and this place Universities are driving me nuts. 
In Mexico public universities are supposed to be affordable (only a few are really free, like the National U), the state university of my home state was really cheap even if the campus in my home city didn't had a lot of careers to offer. The state university of the state where I live now is obscenely expensive, something that I think is not approved by the government, to make it into any career you first have to enter a course which costs the same as 3 or so semesters, and they also charge you for the entrance examen the cost of one semester in this university.
They do this because there's practically no other public universities in this city, only a handful of small engineering schools.
This makes me very anxious since I didn't wanted to take on any career that was too stressful or expensive, and now that I have no other option I'm just obsessing over my career election and thinking about what I am going to do now, because I had already paid for everything and while I was doing their expensive course I ended up disliking the career I had already chose since apparently they're giving it an industrial focus (a career in animation!! with an industrial focus!! good I hate this university so much)

I am writing this since I was doing virtual exams for the course even tho I don't want to get in anymore and I forgot this morning I had another one and it just made feel like a failure. 
I don't really wanna do all this college nonsense, I feel like there is no point and I would prefer passing my time learning practical thinks like coding, urban agriculture and how to start a small business, but in México things have been really bad and even my relatives with 'well payed' careers are struggling (hell, my dad is an engineer with 18+ years of experience and he was on the verge of being unemployed last year). 
I just don't now what to do anymore, I don't really have a dream job I don't dream about working for someone else, I like making projects and things like that. I already suffer a lot from anxiety and depression, and I think I have to see a terapist. 
Thank you if you got to this point of the rant.

It is possibly, in the modern age, one of the most pointless jobs to exist, but I would be hailed as a “job creator”, “stimulating the economy”, and the worker who does the work would be seen as a “hard worker” with “an impressive work ethic.

Just earlier, I had an argument with my mother and sister on the nature of jobs that exist for the sake of jobs existing, and I mentioned that the 40-hour week is an arbitrary construct design to drain people of the energy needed to rebel against the structure. They then defaulted to the idea that work can be 30 weeks, but I suggested that it could be even less if we evaluated what our real needs as society are (remember, I’m just starting with lesser work hours, I can’t even discuss communism yet). Immediately, I was called “lazy” and that “people need to work”. 

(Conclusion/TLDR)What the hell is this? These are the same people that say that they would be “bored” with retirement, and if everything were automated, they’ll simply invent new work to do (or more accurately, beg some capitalist to do that, because work in our society is defined by the capitalist paradigm. If you independently decide to copy textbooks and you’re not making money doing so, people would think you’re wasting your time. If you do that under employment, you’re a “hard worker”)

I know others are much worse hit but I needed to get this off my chest and thought it would be unwise to post on my personal social media.

I (28f) interviewed for a new job on a Friday morning. I was offered the position that evening, handed in my notice on Monday morning, by Monday tea time the industry I work in was shut down. I worked one weeks notice, the weekend between finishing one job and beginning another the UK went in to lockdown. I still began my new job and I do have to be thankful to my linemanagers for lying to head office to make sure I started as planned when the instructions were to stop all recruitment which would have left me unemployed.

I work in customer facing administration so have continued to work, in the office, serving customers throughout the pandemic, our company has classed us as key workers, which is total rubbish to be honest. 90% of our job could be done from home.

I started my job 4 days too late to be eligible for the Government job retention scheme. So, whilst every other administrator at my City's branch has been furloughed for 3 weeks at a time, each on full pay, I have been working every weekday and picking up their work too. Security have been furloughed on the same basis and managers have been in work on a rotating basis, 3 days working from home, 2 days in the office. Myself and the two maintenance technicians are the only ones who have been in as normal. Don't get me wrong, I am so relieved they have been able to stay at home and mitigate some risk and im pleased the company have done the right thing and topped up their wage so theyre not doing  without. I wouldnt have that any other way for them. But i have been feeling very overwhelmed.

I started my job in March and brought up at the time that the salary on the contract I signed would be below National Minimuim Wage as of April 1st when it increased. I was assured it would be amended as soon as the increase came in to effect. Last month my pay slip was confusing as I had worked an extra week so I trusted everything was okay but when I received my second slip this morning I realised I'm still being paid at the original salary, that is around £600 a year under the new minimuim wage. 

On top of this, the accounts department have not submitted my details to HMRC so I have been emergency taxed by around £300 a month for the last two months. Ive rang HMRC and they said its with my company to fix it as the tax code they have generated for me is correct. 

I am extremely lucky to be in work and to be staying with my parents who aren't charging me rent right now. Maybe I'm being petty, but I feel so cheated out of money ive earned and so stressed I wont be able to afford to live when I move in to my own place next month. I want to cry.

TLDR have worked full time, customer facing during a pandemic only to be paid under min wage and have  nearly 25% of my wage taken in tax",Just a personal rant.,12

Hello! I found this sub about a month ago and I wanted to say thanks for being here, I really appreciate the variety of content on here.   
So, I just kind of wanted to talk about my frustrations with work being trash and having chronic pain and if anyone can help that's appreciated but not at all a need. This post is a bit of an organizational mess, I do apologize for that.  


So, the company I work for is one of many that are under fire a lot for labor practices. I'm currently on leave, initially was unpaid, but now is paid because the city passed a new piece of emergency legislation that told them they have to pay for people on COVID-19 related leave (I am potentially at risk for having a bad time if i catch it). I think they're only going to pay me for 30 days worth though, wasn't clear to me.  
Under the normal conditions, I'm underpaid for the work I do, and constantly in pain (which keeps getting progressively worse) and exhausted from a workday and require my entire weekend to recover because I have to be on my feet about 70-80% of the day. My medical issues don't have a diagnosis either.  
The communication was slim with management, its usually bare bones, despite me being in field most of the time and not seeing them every week. This was significantly less than usual though, one email I sent to them about leave, said I could do administrative duties or whatever from home, was just told to take the leave.   
They've since hired a new person for my role, no prior communication, I found out from this person introducing themself on Slack (I got a notification because it was an @ everyone type post, which I'm keeping on since they're infrequent)   
I was essentially planning to take this work experience from here, some of which is helpful for a resume and go elsewhere, but it's been bleak. I feel really confused on what I can do for myself right now. I essentially cannot keep working in a role like this. I really would be better off switching to a work-from-home desk job due to the nature of my pain and medical issues but I just have no idea what I'm even supposed to look for since all but one of the jobs I've had were word-of-mouth from a friend or coworker/boss. I would rather do something part time vs sit on my ass all day at this point.   
At this point I don't know if I even should ask for a different internal role that I can manage better due to my chronic pain, I never really divulged the issue with my bosses and I have no idea how that would go. (In the past when I've brought it up, I was sabotaged and then fired for reasons related to the sabotage)  
I mean, yes I would love to not have to work, but I really can't be in that position right now, I have been trying to save money in order to have a financial cushion. I find if I don't have any sort of income that is a net positive for me (greater than my expenses) then I fall into an anxiety spiral, even if I have money saved.   
I'm also still on payroll, I just confirmed that this morning. I am fairly certain I can't get unemployment because this is a case of taking leave, not hours cut or anything like that. I just really feel limited due to my position with chronic pain and being a bit medically risky. I am open to advice.","[rant] I work in a shitty job for a shitty company, I'm on leave due to COVID risk, company is not communicating well, can't even really do the job due to chronic pain",13

So then people started applying for partial unemployment which would help a lot thanks to the extra $600 you get a week, however some people were asked to work an extra day (still not normal hours) but that made them ineligible for unemployment benefits. When they brought this up to management so they could get their hours moved around (ie maybe work one full week then a short week so they could at least get unemployment for the short week) management decided to increase EVERYONE's hours so no one will complain and now no one is eligible for unemployment. I am a temp so I don't even have any benefits, I would be better off just getting laid off completely and benefit from the unemployment, also we had 3 positive cases of COVID-19 so we are risking our health going into work.

Longtime lurker, but I've been hesitant to reach out to the Internet for some reason. (An odd crippling fear it'd come back to me somehow?) This is going to be kinda disjointed, I just need to get it out and see what happens. I apologize in advance for the crazy length. (I'll try to cut bits if it's too freaking long)

I posted here because I feel all of Reddit's normal ""advice"" channels would just tell me I'm not being practical, wasted a bunch of time, should pull up my boot straps, hit up a ton of job fairs and binge ""motivational"" material.

**About me:** I'm between 20-30-something, no degree, live with my wife and her two family members.

I've worked at a public-facing help desk in Nevada for too many years now. It pays well enough for being a part-time job, but dealing with a very-regularly nutty public has spurred plenty of chronic anxiety/depression over the years. I'm constantly looking for my way out.

It's the very definition of dead-end: Because I have no degree, there's literally a hard ceiling directly above me. That's it.

In real life I'm a 3D artist and studying game development on my own, where I've built a number of creative skills over the years, but I'm in this awkward ""valley"" where it seems like none of them are to a level where they are ""worth"" anything!

Point being, I've always hated this job, but we got lucky in that they continued to pay us while we sheltered in place due to the pandemic. The governor's orders are the only thing holding them back from putting us in danger for ""wave 2.""

At first, it was a total dream! I got to stay home and work on my art as best I could. The hope was that this was all I needed to be up and running. I could get a portfolio and maybe start selling my art so I'd never work in another ""business environment"" again.

""Maybe when they tell me I can come back to work I can just say 'Thanks but no thanks, I'm sure somebody else needs it more than I do. Good luck with that."" ...but I was just fooling myself, I think.

Well, if the lockdown persists past late May, they'll stop paying us. Then comes layoffs and furloughs. I hate this job anyway and I don't want to wait around to be booted to the Unemployment system (which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't completely overloaded right now.)

So, I thought maybe I'd finally get around to putting together my personal website. I'd find a place I could at least deal with working while I figured everything out...but then I realized ""What would I put on it?"" I feel like I have nothing to offer. Like I'm a joke.

Job searching is the most depressing thing in the world because I feel like I could step up from ""customer service"" and finally put my skills to use, but I'm expected to already be some kind of master. I'm not a ""specialist"" or an ""engineer"" for anything, so what, am I basically doomed until I go from 0 to ""nailed it"" all of a sudden?

I want to make an ""anti-resume"", stating that I'm a sociable polymath looking for an environment to cooperate in, rather than be someone else's ""people product."" But I still feel like I don't have anything ""tangible"" to offer.

Time's ticking, I simply don't have enough time to ""develop myself as an artist"" and somehow turn that into cash all of a sudden. I would go back to school just to get a ""See? I told you I can do shit."" degree, but my wife is currently in university and that's about all we can manage right now.

If I search for jobs, I come up empty and I just burned a ton of time I could have been building up artwork, but also I'm just too slow at artwork to have a sizable portfolio or catalogue or whatever ready to go.  How the hell do I find my voice when I'm constantly up against the wall?

**Basically?**

Nevada's pretty damn unfriendly to co-ops and anarchists by its very nature, seeing as what IS settled  here is basically a capitalist cash-farm colony. It's ""hustle-central.""

I don't know where to escape to, and I don't know how to put my existing abilities to use for support before I'm driven into yet another ""service-industry"" hellhole.

What kind of work out there is friendly to fellow anti-corporates?

I just can't do it. I can't look another empty-suit interrogator in the face and tell them ""I have such a passion for leaving my own dignity at the door and building a career as a people-person who LIVES to SERVE your CUSTOMERS!""

Background: Junior in College

I'm a fairly lazy person; I have ADHD and I physically cannot sit still and read a book unless it's really engaging. I procrastinate to all hell, especially when it's work that I know (or think I know) I can do well on within the last minute. As an aside, I do have OCD, general anxiety, and I likely also have depression, but that remains to be diagnosed.   


So, with that said, the quarantine has made things go from ""oh this is manageable, I can still contribute and be a good student, albeit not a model one"" to ""Fuck it, I don't care, I just want to die."" I feel dread about having to make an arbitrary number of 150 word posts every week for classes, go to zoom classes and talk to people, and I just am generally depressed. Being online as much as I am is shit for my health and ability to talk to people, too, despite being a really introverted person. I would rather do non-academic things, such as modding or writing lore for roleplaying games, and I am generally happier when I do those things.  I feel horrible for not wanting to do this work, but like, part of me is annoyed that my fellow students are expected to just be able to function. I'm sure some of us can, but not all of us, and I think  that's acceptable when there's a literal crisis going on.   


So, uh, anyone else feel the same way? Why not just cut this semester out and do it next year. Everything's fucked up anyways, so why...why not?",Anyone else wanting to just check out of classes n' stuff? (Rant),5

His statements to this idea indicate that he never loses and that the US will win so much we will tire of it. I am tired of it, but not for the assumed reasons of boredom.

I am weary because of the false dichotomy which ""winning"" implies. To ""win"" there must be at least two conditions. 1: we are in a competition. 2: there is at least one loser.

This obsession with ""winning"" isn't Trump's invention. I believe that this obsession is borne from scarcity economics and a economic system built on competition. In short I believe this is a direct fruit of capitalism.

The result of this obsession of ""winning"" is apparent to many of you here. But, there is a more subtle aspect (to me) that worms its way into our behavior. I speak of a dichotomy. This either/or stance and focus on dualism is a root of many difficulties in coming together; us or them; blue or red; labor or capital; poor or rich; black or white; good or evil; winning or losing.

This mentality tends to assume that existance is a zero sum game and that there is finite room and resources (at our current population and resource extraction). I have observed that this kind of simplistic thinking mainly afflicts those of a conservative persuasion but this thinking can effect anyone since it is so persistent in our language.

I would like to say, that I do not wish to win. I just wish to be. I wish to work for my bread and then be left to my books. I do not wish to ""beat"" my brothers and sisters at some economic game (it does not make fun sport). I would rather take a liesurely stroll in the meadow or next to the brook with my brethren and sistren.","A tirade (rant) against the false dichotomy of ""winning""",18

This pandemic is a chance to prove how valuable working from home truly can be. However, I've noticed many companies taking advantage of it. In my experience, since employees are all at their new ""place of work"" 24/7, we can be contacted at any time. We have no commute, so there's more time to work. We can't go anywhere or do anything, so we have no excuse not to work, in my company's eyes.

My workload has been steadily increasing for the past 6-7 months, even while working from home. My current workload justifies about 80-90 hours a week right now. And they don't offer OT pay.

I had a hard enough time separating my work life and personal life before all this, and it's obviously only gotten worse the past two weeks. My boss contacts me all hours of the day, expecting me to be working. If I get everything done that's expected of me in 40-50 hours a week, I'm happy and my bosses are happy. But even working inappropriate amounts of OT the past few weeks, I've fallen behind.

I feel guilty every time I take a break and ignore calls/emails, but I'm not going to let my company take advantage of me. I've decided to cut my time off at 60 hours a week, which even then is 20 hours too many. If that's not good enough, then there are plenty of people looking for jobs right now that they should hire to help me out.

If nothing else, COVID-19 is a great chance to prove how viable WFH can be. (I also acknowledge that 40 hrs of OT is better than no job or income at all.) But I'm noticing companies are doing what they can to take advantage of this pandemic as well as their employees, and we need to be careful to not let it spiral out of control and not let them use this to squeeze out everything they can from us.

That's the end of my rant, but I'm posting here because I'm curious if others are seeing similar attitudes from their employers. I also want to note that I'm very grateful I still have a job and I don't take it lightly. I live with others who weren't as fortunate. This will be an interesting financial situation to navigate, and obviously I'm doing everything I can to keep us all afloat.","Ctrl+V'ing a rant I just went on elsewhere, about companies taking advantage of WFH during COVID-19.",10

There is absolutely no reason why we can’t do that in 6 hours a day for 4 days a week WITHOUT scrapping wages. People spend too much time dicking around at work anyway.

Yes. We all need to move to a 24 hour standard workweek.

Also, not everybody needs to lock themselves in a 40 year career in their early 20’s! My dad bought into this life script, as did most people in my family, and it depresses the hell out of me. Dad’s never lived outside of our home state. Dad’s been at the same company for 30 years. I think that he never realized that there is another way, and the thought of spending my life the same way DEPRESSES me. Too many people buy into the bullshit that everybody has to have a full time job and a career where we spend too many hours of our short existence in a cubicle.

I was working at Mellow Mushroom (Atlanta based pizza chain) and was going out to see the world before...all this shit happened. 

Seriously, I was like two months away from packing my life up and heading for the west coast. Why? I realized I don’t WANT to hang around our home state and look for a career like so many in my family do. I want to see the world. Learn things. Have my own time to devote to hobbies. Money is important, yes, but it’s not a be all end all. I don’t want more money than I need to be comfortable and have a good life.

And, yes, I might decide down the line that I want to apply myself in a career. There is no reason why I can’t do that 10 years from now. I’m 23 and a college grad (who is fortunate to have no debt.) My family can’t wrap their head around “I don’t want a career right now” There are so many things in the world I want to do. I’ll work because I need to, not because I want to, and nobody will convince me that I want to.

Maybe some people find fulfillment in a career for 40 years, and my hat is off to them. That’s not me. That’s not everybody. That’s just some bullshit they spoon feed us so we don’t question things.

This whole situation has been very stressful for me because I live with dumbass boomers because I don't make enough to move out. So over the last week we've had like 3 to 4 arguments full of yelling and cursing over me still going to work.

I don't have a car, I can't afford rent for even a 1x bedroom, and the one situation where I can actually make a decent wage and save, I'm supposed to stop working to make you assholes feel better. And suppose I stop going in? My boomer mom will burn through all my car savings in a week with how entitled she is. Basically, either way I lose. I stop working, I could lose my job, my income, and any oppurtunity I had before a fucking depression happens. And if I keep working, I can get a virus that might kill me (even though I'm 20)....so either way I'm still fucked!

You know what's even more infuriating? The same people saying this own their own big ass house, have multiple cars, AND MAKE FUN OF ME FOR HAVING STUDENT LOAN DEBT. They think the election is a joke, and they make fun of Bernie Sanders. Yet they get mad because I refuse to watch videos about plagues with them on the couch, and I remind them that they deserve this fucking shit for their incompetence. My sister, the person driving A FUCKING MERCEDES-BENZ! makes fun of me for being stuck riding a bicycle, but she'll readily call me selfish and entitled for not quiting my job. SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO WORK, SHE CAN LOCK HER OFFICE AND COME HOME AT ANY TIME AND NOBODY WILL SAY ANYTHING! I can't do that! My job barely gives me dental and eyecare! I DON'T EVEN GET HEALTH INSURANCE

TL;DR: I find it so infuriating that the same people who insured young people don't make a living wage, bitch about young people still working in the middle of a pandemic because they have no other choice but to work to try and survive.

Constant promises of things that were not remotely possible. I knew it was wishful thinking and not purposeful lying, but it's tiring. I was willing to work things out, try therapy, etc - they were not. 

Regardless, I loved them. Incredibly. My stupid brain has spent the last few days mad about superficial bullshit instead of feeling my feelings (""I left my favorite pillow at their house and I'll never get it back ugh"" etc) Because it's too fucking hard. I don't have time. I have to go to work on Monday. I have to pretend to have my shit together in a day and a half rather than being able to actually take the time to get my shit together. 

I read a comment somewhere once that said ""most jobs don't care as long as you show up, you could come in and do nothing as long as you show up"". What kind of dumb fucking garbage bullshit is that? I mean, it's true, I've heard countless stories and done it myself. I'm a ""fantastic employee who they don't want to lose"" when I show up. But if I can come sit and do nothing then why the absolute fuck is it such a huge dramatic blowout with multiple managers involved when I call out sick? When I texted my boss Friday they literally replied ""Ugh. I need you to ask other associates to cover"" Um... WHAT. No I do not. That is in your fucking job description to make sure all shifts are covered. It literally says a huge part of your job is covering sick shifts. If I have to spend 3 hours texting everyone on staff to see who can cover, then put me on the clock for it. How are you getting paid 5x more than me with that kind of professionalism. Fuck off. 

Really boosts the already-low morale when you don't get paid enough to live but also get told your job matters so little you can come in and sit here, but you HAVE to be here. Why? Just why. So I can say ""hello"" to people who come in? Get a fucking robot if it matters that little. Pretty sure customers would rather have a robot than someone who can't even look at them with their dead eyes from sobbing uncontrollably. 

The expectation that people get over loss in a day or two is insane. I just want to be able to have a mental health week or two and not go broke over it, is that honestly too much to ask? Yeah suddenly getting shifts covered for multiple days is a sudden increase in work, but how do these people not expect to plan for it?

I know that, and you know I know that. You aren't helping. There's no 'correct' response to ""you have to""; it's a silencing tactic. If that's what you're here for - fuck off.

I've been employed for 2 years and unemployed for 2 before that, and I know which one I prefer.

the second most common response is ""you would get bored"". I AM bored. I'm bored shitless, I'm more bored than I've ever been. What I do for a living is not something I would do to alleviate boredom on my worst day, I'd rather burble incoherently facefirst into the carpet.

Sure, when I was unemployed I had days where I didn't get out of bed until 12. I still have them; I'm physically out of bed, back straight, eyes fixed on nothing, work piling up unanswered because nobody's home. I stay late, only mouldering, and my boss demands I stay yet later; and I have no way to articulate that no threat, no pleading, no violence can make me keep working because there is nothing left. Those days are becoming every day.

People tell me that I need to take more time off, which is true, but misses the point: I don't want to work a week from now any more than I want to work tomorrow. Role playing freedom brings me no joy.

I can't even tell anyone that I don't want to work. They bargain - but [the utility function is not up for grabs][1]; they act like they didn't hear, or like they don't understand. I feel a little less real every time this perfectly simple statement falls on deaf ears:

I’m 28 years old. I work for my local city government. I have two jobs (I teach part-time on top of my government job). 

This year, I was able to be enrolled in my job’s health insurance plan. I sustained a gnarly injury last year that I haven’t yet recovered from, so I was very excited to get better health insurance to take care of my healing. 

Today was, as I’m sure it was for many of you, payday. I don’t make a lot of money, but over the last couple of years I’ve made enough. I’ve struggled, but I also don’t work full-time. That’s the trade off I’ve made. I struggle a little bit but I have more time for myself. It’s worked for the most part. 

Well, today the money was pulled from my check for my employer-based health insurance. And, lo &amp; behold, 2/3 of my paycheck has disappeared to pay for my health insurance. 

Because of this, I can’t pay my rent. I also wouldn’t be able to afford my copay at the physical therapist I’m seeing if it weren’t for the help I’m receiving from my parents. I have to go into greater credit card debt to pay for groceries  until I get paid again. My car payment has to be delayed.

This is it. If I want health insurance, then one of my two monthly checks will be spent on it. It’s increasingly difficult to live a life to find meaning in. (Don’t read too much into this — I’m not suicidal, I’m just bummed out right now). I don’t get how I’m supposed to make this work, but I guess I’m gonna have to find a fkn way. 

In the meantime, if there wasn’t a fire under my ass before, I’ll be spending every free moment I have canvassing and phone banking for Bernie Sanders because (at the ripe old age of 28) I need Medicare for All.

When I started the company deceived me i to thinking they WeRe LikE a FamiLy and NoT lIkE tHe oThEr ComPanIes.
I really believed them.




They're not even a little better...
Not at all.



Instead of closing the shop for ONE DAY, so we can take inventory during that day, they let us come and work a full shift and basically AFTER the shop closes at SEVEN PM, we may start taking inventory.
Instead of closing the shop for example on the statistically weakest day of the year (regarding profit), they make us stay until 2am on a saturday...
The only day where we can use our nights and go out with friends or family.



Generously they announced the rates for our wage, after the shop closes:
First 3 hours u til 10pm: 10€ (few cents more than minimum wage).
The rest of the time: rediculous 12.5€. For some people this even less than what they're making on normal days.



The people who are in charge will spend the day walking around, observing.
Maybe acting like they're working at times, pushing a cart through the shop.

As the departmental move allowed me to work from home, I semi-reluctantly accepted the new position.

Fast-forward to today, when I receive an email from my old boss. Because my old department is now horrendously understaffed - and who could have ever predicted that, am I right? - I’m now expected to pitch in on my down time to help them on an ongoing basis.

I will not be receiving an increase in my wages for this extra work.

This is a story repeated over and over again in late-capitalist America. Working people are expected to take on ever more labor, work ever longer hours and ever increase their productivity for the same (or less!) pay. And It should therefore be abundantly clear to anyone paying attention that it’s the managerial and owner classes who really want “free stuff” - free man-hours, free labor and free output. They want it from you and me, and they know that they can take it, because - by and large - we have no other choice but to accept their terms.

I think insurance in my area is the same  - even worse because you are told to take a ""prep"" course before getting licensed at the first level. No wonder why the recruiter was interested in me (guy with about 1.5 years of experience) because they saw a way to make money off me first.

Some things I really hate about the UK system are:

\-Unpaid overtime (seriously, I have lost count of the amount of times I worked hours extra to cope with deadlines)

\-Having to finish someone else's work despite having finished mine; he will then go home early and I am forced to stay and finish someone else's work because sr manager says so

\-London is full of materialistic people

\-Drug use drives me crazy; these employees now have more energy to cope with high demands making you look ""lazy""

\-Extremely poor worker's rights (you can in fact, lose your job if you become pregnant, no rights until you've worked with them 2 years, also if something bad happens like unfair dismissal, even if you were to win the case the next employers won't touch you and you may be unemployed forever)

\-Directors/higher people have a habit of screaming at employees (not always, but in 50% of places they do)

\-Backstabbing colleagues (esp as a woman working with other women)

\-Lack of appreciation towards your work as the city has such a large talent pool they can get someone new anytime

\-Obsession with process improvements (like, there is only so much you can ""improve"" without risking making your own role obsolete)

\-Obsession with after work drinks and failure to attend will make you look antisocial. for me, even if I like my team, I have no interest in alcohol, I want to go home and recover or walk in a park

\-Extremely few annual holiday and sick days (this isn't Norway)

\-Extremely poor/low salaries compared to cost of living. And this is even for highly-skilled people. Unless you're a director getting £100k, you may struggle. Most beginners get between £20k-24£. Pathetic.

\-No tolerance for employees being late, even though we have some of the worst trains I've ever seen, frequently late/cancelled, overpriced and dirty

\-No willingness to let people work from home",Rant about working in hostile London,13

I am in my early 30s, have been working continuously for about 11 years now. I am what I guess is called a “highly skilled professional”, meaning I have an office job that pays way above the median. I live and work in a first-world European country meaning that I’m easily in the top 0.5% of the global population income-wise.

It’s a day before payday today. I have about $5 cash, and close to $20k of debt. I don’t have anything of value. No house nor flat, no bonds or shares, no jewellery or works of art. No savings of any kind. If I sold everything I own I might get maybe $3k? Hard to tell - a dated gaming pc, some tools and power tools, some kitchen stuff, stacks of books.

I don’t have a car or a licence - I did a course years ago, so I know how to, but never did the exam because money. And also didn’t have money for the car anyway, and I wouldn’t use it daily as public transport was and is much quicker.

I don’t drink alcohol. I don’t do any kind of drugs. I don’t smoke tobacco (I admittedly vape). I might spend up to a $100 per month on games - humble bundles, some dlc to my favourites, but of pay2win crap elsewhere.

I wear clothes I have. I’m not bothered by labels, I don’t have anything of a recognisable brand. I buy just “quality” clothes that will last me a long time, and usually only replace them. Trends don’t apply to me, I’m either jeans and t-shirt most of the days, and tweed if I feel fancy.

I rent a flat, I’d say in the middle of a price range. 1 bedroom, rather cramped, but good commute and safe neighbourhood.

I spend probably a bit too much on takeout, because as much as I love cooking, after a full day of work it’s not very enjoyable. But still, it’s maybe 5-6 times a month, and it’s pizza or McDonalds, nothing fancy.

I also spend a bit too much on food. I could go for “Italian style hard cheese” instead of Parmesan, or just bacon instead of pancetta, but did I mention I love cooking? Also candies and pastries - I’m a sweet tooth, sue me.

I haven’t had a steak in months. Beef is too expensive. Usually the meat is either sausage, bacon or sometimes mince. Often there’s no meat, just legumes, cheese, eggs and dairy as a source of fat and protein.

I have stopped going to Starbucks and other crap coffee establishments, switched to black tea with milk. I stopped eating lunch at work, I’ll just bring something from home to keep me going until the evening.

And I’m still just spiralling down. Well, I kind of know why. I have two people who are financially dependent on me. Don’t really want to go into why and how, but the fact is they are, and if I leave them hanging they are absolutely and completely screwed.

One of them I just spend flat 18.5% of salary on as a handout. The second lives with me, so it’s hard to estimate the actual cost. Some electricity, some food, some cash. While it does explain the gaping budget hole, I’m still blaming the current economy for it. I’m supposedly wealthy, on paper, aren’t I?

Recently I’ve been looking around on an app there like a Facebook for neighbourhoods. I did some computer repair, pc building for an older couple, I did some handyman work as well - I’m a DIY enthusiast. While I highly enjoyed it, I also did it for money. Some bucks here, some bucks there. Usually I just say with perfect honesty that I’m not a registered self employed person, so I cannot ask for any money, but I can accept a gift. People are quite generous when they are happy with what I do, and I’m an honest and conscientious guy. I show up on time, I get stuff done, I don’t bullshit.

However as I’ve mentioned I don’t have a car. I also don’t want to incur wrath of the tax authorities. So I only just offer my services, outside of my day job hours, on the neighbour board, when someone is looking for something I can do. I don’t advertise, because I feel it would be silly to be a handyman on the weekends and late evenings only. But I’m happy to do some actual work with my hands, interact with people, and put the tools to use (as I’m currently renting a flat, they don’t see any real use).

I’m at the end of a rope really. I probably could Hail Mary, get a loan from my bank and continue the status quo few more months, but that is not a solution.

I will probably be forced to hang one of the people who are dependent on me out to dry. And it’s killing me. I worked hard for over a decade, I’m really good at what I do. I kept away from most vices, I spend my free time either doing some side gigs for spare change or doing things for friends for free - tutoring, helping, you name it.

I tried to live my life as my mother taught me. Don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t backstab, love people, help others, be happy with what you have. I also listened to my dad: work hard, do your best, bear the cross.

I’m now on heavy antidepressants, after over 15 years of battling depression on my own. I never surrendered to the demons inside me which propose such simple and alluring solutions to my anguish. It did help to think that my life has meaning to others, and that’s why it is so hard right now. I’m presented with a choice of basically betraying the way I lived my life and abandon someone, or keep trying to carry that cross of mine, hoping it doesn’t crush me. 

But I’ve tried and tried and just can’t. I did some math recently. In the past 5 years at my company I’ve had two pay rises, one of them due to a promotion. I’ve applied the inflation, the taxes and I now earn 2% less than 5 years ago in actual purchasing power. The game is rigged. The inflation is and the power of the government, but the salaries at the hands of the private. And yes, I could play that game. Leverage the employer, hunt for better paying job, start my own business. But all those things require money to start with. And with no savings, only debt, it’s a no go. And to build the capital I’d have to implement radical cost saving measures which in turn bring me back to abandoning another human in need.

I won’t lie, I’d gladly work more to make ends meet. I hate working in general, I’m an UBI supporter and proponent, I can do a lot of things for the world outside of my job, but I’d be lying if I said that I wouldn’t work more.

However, no paid overtime at my company, just TOIL (time off in-lieu). And finding another employer in my field who would want my services during my free time proved to be very hard. I did offer around some freelance services (so work whenever, deliver on agreed time), but that’s also rare, and a lot of that stuff can be outsourced for cheap.

This is incredibly long and if you got to the end, thank you. I really just needed to vent, to put my thoughts in order, and I don’t like to write things that will never see the light of day. Thank you.",Rant,55

In the past 4 weeks I've attained 48% of my quarterly goal and also been awarded MVP at the company.
Working from home provided me with extra time to sleep.  I didn't have to drive anywhere.  I saved a lot of money and time just cutting out my commute.  My job is meaningless in the sense that I just forward emails to people.  In these 4 weeks I was able to do a ton of cleanup/organization around the house and even work on art projects (read: improving and working on myself).  I finished a commission piece that I delayed for months, usually delayed it because I was too tired to work on it after being in the office all day.
That's not to say that my work from home experience was entirely stress free, I had some bad/busy work days, but the nature of my work simply doesn't require 8 hours a day in an office, obviously, given the attention directed at ""work"" while I've been at home.

The only thing is, I would have paid probably $600 out of pocket to go through all my medical bullshit without the health insurance provided by my employer.  It's a rusty, double-edged sword.  

I can't fake my illness any longer and have to go back to the office on Monday.  This shit sucks.  My experience in the past month shows me that the work is meaningless.  This lifestyle is worthless.  I'm wasting my time sending emails for somebody who doesn't care about anything other than their ever-expanding bottom line.  I have to depend on putting my time in with this entity in order to afford to live without fear of sudden and detrimental debt.  It's such a cruel existence.

All that being said, I truly do realize how lucky I am to have landed such a position that gives me health insurance and an opportunity to work from home, because I know it could have been much worse.",[RANT] The work means nothing,22

I took pride in my work and pushed for the best stats in the place (I got a badge for being top 100 😓). Not an actual monetary benefit. 

Every time I peaked and hit a target, they switched the goal posts and pushed me harder for the next threshold.

There is no endgame! No completion or reward. They just squeeze and push you on repeat.

My immune system was shattered by stress so I took some sick days to recover, they put me in a room and had me justify the sicknesses infront of three managers. They put me on a ""sickness stage"" which is essentially a disciplinary after weeks of hounding because I didn't want to take strong painkillers to get me back into work. 

I was micro managed to a ridiculous extent, penalised for taking too many pee breaks basically forcing me into a state of permanent dehydration. I was placed in an ""evaluation"" where I again had to justify the amount of times a day I urinate! These meetings play out like police interrogations. 

Any sort of career progression involves being a manager on secondment, this is something I'd never heard of before working there. What it essentially means is you are a manager, with all of the responsibilities but none of the pay. You do the exact same job as managers. You've got all these desperate people wanting a better wage, absolutely killing themselves for the title. They're taking their work home with them living and breathing the company in the hopes of getting paid for what they're already doing! I knew secondment managers that hadn't been offered the actual job for 5 years! 

The company would fend us off against other call centres in stat competitions and reward us for winning. They gave us little packets of haribo, one year they put a ferris wheel in the carpark. They'd give us a spin on a roulette wheel for transferring to sales, 1 in 10 chance of a 2 minute break.      

I'm just so sick of being treated like a fucking child with these pseudo rewards so they dont have to fork out for any meaningful rewards...yno...like money. Or being fairly paid for the work you do.

The absolute worst thing of all is the people around me eat this shit up! They love it! You're taught to think you're some sort of grinch if you dont play along with a smile on your face. If you dont take the overtime when asked you're considered a maverick.

And the long term managers...holy shit. The personality types they hire for these positions are uniform. These small people who milk situations of hierarchy and a minuscule amount of power for all it's worth. You can tell they relish their position because it gives them the opportunity to talk to you poorly. 

I managed to get out of there and into a more traditional office job where they treat you like an adult. But to all my brothers and sisters still in the trenches, please know that you come first!

I will be graduating around spring 2021. And this subreddit has made me think quite a lot about where I want my life to go after graduation. Since childhood I have always been artistically minded, loving to sing and dance and write and express myself however I could. I have maintained that mindset to this day, though with college I rarely take the time to hone my skills. 

And I have known since I was a teenager that I never ever ever ever wanted an “office job”, “cubicle job”, “9 to 5” deal, whatever you want to call it. I have said aloud many times that I’d rather be a waitress who works on music in her spare time or even homeless than work a desk job. 

My parents set me up from the beginning that being “successful” was the most important thing in the world and that is what they want from/for me. But their idea of success is quite different from mine. They’re less strict than the typical parents you’d think of, but still prioritized my grades and “success” in classes over everything, while hypocritically at the same time trying to tell me to pursue my singing and writing interests. 

I have dreams of being a singer, making albums and touring and sharing my music with the world. On top of that I have dreams of writing novels and TV scripts and movie scripts and sharing those with the world too. 

But guess what? My major is Russian. Yes, Russian. The language. I do like it a lot and am good at it but it has literally nothing to do with my true dreams. I have literally no intention of getting a job in the translator/government whatever the fuck Russian field. I will not do it. I blatantly refuse, because it’s not what I want.

No one besides me knows this, but since perusing this sub and seeing how miserable it is to be stuck in this work-all-day system, I have decided I am going to join a commune after graduation. I spent a lot of time yesterday going through many in several states and have bookmarked a few I’m interested in for further research. I will do whatever it takes to join one of these and contribute to a community whose goals aren’t productivity and profit but rather reconnecting with nature and the natural world around us, with other human beings, taking time to actually breathe and go outside for once in a damn while. It might sound hippy dippy but to me it also sounds like a dream come true. 

I see myself living on this commune, doing physical labor in exchange for my shelter and just enjoying the sunshine and I have no problem with that. And I’m a tiny physically weak girl who’s lived in the suburbs nearly her whole life! *Still* I’d rather work on a farm with other individuals than work a desk job. That’s how terrified and disgusted I am with the work culture we have.

I don’t want my life to end up a dead end before it even starts. I see myself living on a commune for maybe about a year, working on the land and then coming inside to write/sing/make instrumentals/cook/clean/maybe even paint or draw even though I’m not very experienced with it. No morning alarms. No commute. No fluorescent lighting replacing sunshine. No meaningless slog. Whenever I get bored I can just pick up another hobby/interest or go out to the field and work some more. Is it going to be utopia? Of course not, I don’t expect my life to suddenly become perfect. But is it much better than any alternative I can think of? Absolutely. 

Here is the site I used to look up communes: https://www.ic.org

I see a lot of people saying they wish they could just pack up one day and leave and I think one way to do that would be to join a commune. Easier said than done of course but there are so many options out there and ways to earn money on the commune by working on the farm/land or doing other tasks. If anyone reading this finds the idea of joining commune interesting, take some time to go on this site and research ones in your state or even in a state you’d like to live in. The site splits up the communes by many many factors so you can narrow your choices down by a lot. Keep in mind there are some communes that require membership fees and monthly fees to keep things running so if you’re seriously considering this make sure you can scrape together the money if necessary (I myself have to figure out how I’m going to do that as well). 

Maybe I’m just a naive kid but having these communes bookmarked gives me some sense of hope that I don’t have to run my life into the ground and I can take my time for myself and do whatever the hell I want instead of joining the traditional workforce the second I’m hot off the college graduation press. I can’t see many downsides to joining just for a year or two or even a few months and again maybe that’s just my dreams clouding my judgment but I still think it’s worth some consideration.

So, I'm in my 20s and working in IT. Even decently talented at what I do, when mental issues aren't getting the better of me. I'm not even poor, median-ish wage but far below median expenses.

So I drive to office every single day to sit on my ass, be around people I would rather avoid that on their own already stress the hell out of me by being obnoxiously loud and, reeking of tobacco smoke and being disgusting, shit like that. Contrary to how that probably sounds, I don't hate everyone, it's more of a ""vocal"" (or visible? somehting like that) minority, but live waaaay out of the way from anyone I'm actually friends (who often tend to be stressed the fuck out, too) with, seeing them a couple of teams a year, decreasing tendency.


Right now, I'm sick, which is not much of a surprise, after a couple of particularly bad weeks, immune system can well be expected to be in the trashcan.


So, what am I working for? Rent and food? That's a worthwhile existence. Buying pointless shit to fuel the economy? Probably going to be preaching to the choir on that one. Having kids? Even if that were realistic, more humans who get to experience this dreary existence? Great! Play a ton of video games? Yeah, that's fulfilling...


With everyone just securing their own existence... or pointless profit, I just don't see how one can be actually happy *without* being ignorant. Like, there is no goal, or at least none that isn't basically obviously just ... hollow, shallow, void...


Delve into pointless but temporarily blissful hedonism? Great! Joining some fanatical cult to get rid of that feeling of emptiness inside? Even better! Spend all that money on psychotherapy? Like, I've already learned a lot about causes, patterns and approaches to cyclical depression, but as long as major contributors to it are basically completely out of my reach to control...


Have I consided moving in order to see friends (like, I don't not care about non-friends, but people you're actually getting along with well enough to be genuine friends are so rare, I value them and their happiness a lot) more often and be able to be ignorant of larger-scale issues more frequently? Sure, but the job market is just such a fucking rat race. Fucking CVs and job interviews, it just feels so degrading. Being judged to the bone for some nonsense like not maintaining eye contact by some fuckhead making people do pointless things with the end goal of facilitating selling even more consumerist junk on computers for money. And you're expected to have certificates, which, while in itself not completely reasonable as qualifications obviously are important, fuels an industry that at this point is like a tumor upon the tumor 90% of IT jobs already are.

Like, I don't see any way this is going to get better. Anti-capitalist / anti-corporate movements with actual traction mostly from before my birth have been crushed from inside already by corruption and totalitarian dictators. Maybe a bit of war and sabotage as well. As a country, a humane model of ecconomy and government (and, being in Europe, I've already got about as close as we can currently get to that, but it's not enough to stop the nihilism) is always going to lose out against an exploiter, so long as nations exist, they are going to bully each other for the benefits of their own respective elites, and the most ruthless will have an edge.


Like... ignorance. So long as you're not -effectively, as society is twisted enough for that to be a *good* thing- fortunate enough to be born a sociopath devoid of empathy, what are you going to do? Work for underwhelming and further diminishing returns, retire completely burnt out and die? Become a hobo/neckbeard/hikkomori/alcoholic/otherdrugaddict/hermit and go full ignorant that way to stave off the despair? Don't think that's going to work. Outright suicide? Blegh.

That's when a voice (from the sales team, of course) pipes up 'You'd be bored if you didn't work though'.
And then my reply of 'I'm bored here, mate. Being bored anywhere else would be a bonus. Besides, I've got too much stuff I want to do to get bored.'

Personally I fucking hate this stupid reason for working. I'd be bored not working? Fuck right off. I can't pack all I want to do into a lifetime of not working, let alone when I am working. I'm a sculptor in my spare time, I have loads of sculpts I want to do. I have loads of movies I want to watch. I want to learn to animate better. I want improve my drawing skills. I want to study writing and do some of my own, I want to learn more about physics, I want to travel to different countries and learn about their culture, and I want to learn a new language. Not to mention there are hundreds of games that I've never gotten around to finishing. I play board games and dungeons and dragons with my friends, doing more of that would be amazing. 

If you feel you would be bored without work, then you really need to realise just what you could do with your time on this planet other than making some other fucker richer while making yourself miserable and denying yourself self improvement.

Really tired at the end of the day, unable to stop thinking about work even on the weekend. Have to have a weekend strategy now to get maximum weekend hours to do stuff. Dread going in, have the Monday Blues (or is it Sunday?) at the end of weekdays now. When I try to do something I enjoy, if it's after work, too tired to do it and/or performance suffers and if it's the weekend I feel like time is being wasted because I only have x amount of hours before I have to prepare to go to work all over again. Also find myself thinking is this the rest of my life? You may have a bunch of hours after work, but you've got no energy to actually take advantage of it therefore your actual life and hobbies die slowly.

To me the way  this is set up is all wrong. Not counting the whole, humans can't get work for a solid 8 hours a day (up to 1 hour's break)  because they're not machines and that the tech exist to fix many problems (let's see if I can remember my points since I thought of them days ago):

* If you decide you want to leave, because maybe you find it's not for you or something you look like the bad guy
* Want to work fewer hours, you look like the bad guy
* Turn down an offer, because maybe you knew it wasn't for you, you look like the bad guy
* If you feel deep inside somewhere in your gut that 9 - 5 grind isn't for you (if you consider that nothing in life is for everyone because we're all different then it stands to reason the 9 - 5 isn't either) you look like the bad guy. Perhaps I knew this way before I got my first job, because whenever I pictured my future a job/work didn't feature. That or I was self employed

Stuff like this makes me increasingly wonder why have children if they're just going to enter the same system. You can't get their consent beforehand as to whether they want to be born and therefore join the system society has set up. To me it seems like a bad idea to bring an unsuspecting person into it, especially if I didn't like it to begin with.

Anyone else feel this?

EDIT: sometimes think 'but it makes money and that's all that matters' or vice versa when I'm doing something or thinking about  one of my hobbies.

 So I work part time at my local animal control and I gotta say, as jobs go, it's the longest and the most satisfied I've ever been with work life. My coworkers are not (all) gossipy bitches, the management is (mildly) understanding and lenient, and the hours are (usually) very manageable with (reasonably) good pay. So overall, I can't complain. But once in awhile I still get this nasty sense that my job is nothing but cleaning up after other people's messes. Be it mistreatment of an animal, people unwilling or unable to euthanize animals themselves, people losing animals in stupid ways, irresponsible breeders, or just people not having a smidge of common sense. 90% of my job is because the human race is shit to the creatures they domesticated and brought into the world themselves. My coworker had to do six euthanasias yesterday for various reasons, some legit, some questionable, and is now at home drinking her weekend away.

My 2nd interview (not as relevant) was for a bakery, but the chef I was supposed to interview with today called me and said her boss made a hire yesterday on her day off. She sounded pissed, I don't hold that against her just because her boss is probably an undermining dick.

https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/cjgu5z/so_many_things_that_jobs_find_red_flags_are_so/

I saw that there are people here. Who like the jobs where you have multiple months off. And you scoffed at people saying you'd get bored.

I feel I've found my people. I have had bouts of unemployment. They would have been fine if it weren't for the financial aspect. After I left my last toxic workplace. I just took a week to relax and sleep and emotionally heal from the damage they place did to me. It literally almost gave me an ulcer. I almost killed myself over a fucking $15 an hour job.

That week off of doing nothing. Not worrying about any schedules. No plans. Was one of the most healing weeks of my life.

I am working right now in my life more than I ever did. I don't know if I'll ever get the full freedom from work. But, my future goals involve saving up to have extended time off.

My boyfriend and I are moving to a cheaper rent. So that he can go to school to get a better job. 

We were really gonna try to stick it out where we currently live. We thought going into a different field would be a different experience for him. Unfortunately. The state of America in modern day, and how capitalism has managed to make it legal to fire you if you form a union (among a myriad of other issues). The vast majority of entry level jobs are full of bullshit. Doesn't matter the field.

I've had many people tell me he needs to not be lazy and get a part time job.

I've chosen to support him. I make enough money to support him. I also wasn't complaining about supporting him. I didn't say I couldn't. I was just sharing. ""Hey, I'm about to do this thing.""

**We** don't want him to get a physical psrt time job. Because part time jobs love to do this thing of ""Oh, you're only available 25 hours a week? Alright. Well we'll feel fully entitled to **all** of your time. Schedule you on days you wanted off. And threaten your job if you ask for some basic respect of your time.""

And they'll inevitably do the thing. Where they schedule you close one night, and open the next day. And they will never give you a consistent schedule. Even though it's what every. Single. Employee. Wants. And they'll never post it in a timely manner. And change the schedule on you without telling you and then discipline you for being late. Because apparently being a manager in a retail store means you can actively ignore details. Like Fred picks up his kid every Friday, so he can't work close. But you schedule him anyway. While micro managing and yelling at your subordinates about things that are out of their control.

Apparently I'm an idiot for not wanting him to deal with this nonsense and focus on school. 

There area couple basic online jobs that would bring in an OK income. And pay a lot more than the awful minimum wage job in the area. So we're going to try to get him those. But if not. He'll still be taking care of the house (which will be such a blessing with how much I'm working). And learning extremely brain intensive things like coding. I don't want his head space occupied about how he didn't meet the quota for inventory. 

He's getting a software development degree, I'm going to get a marketing degree. We've talked about how I could help him get into freelancing by working on the marketing stuff. 

The big plan is to go to South Korea. We hope he'll have a remote job (or maybe freelancing) by then. We'll have free housing. I'll be a TEFL teacher in the public schools. I am currently a TEFL teacher online. I do really enjoy the work. Though it's not what I'd be doing if I didn't need to pay bills.

It's common to get to South Korea, work in public schools for the first year. And then move to a Hagwon (private school). Because they pay more. But you get far less vacations. You're often working extra on the public holidays because public school is closed and parents still send their kids out. And a lot more stress.

I am hoping to stay in SK for 3 years. And will gladly take the 2 weeks paid vacation. With the many paid public holidays off. You also have to come into the office during winter break and sit around all day. The smart ones do something meaningful to them during this time. Msny study their distance masters. Or write their novels. I'll be working on my passion project. I will happily trade a little more money for a lot more time.

I'll stay in SK for 3 years. I'll then use the savings from those 3 years to spend 18-24 months living in cheap beautiful tropical countries and working on my passion project.

I saw multiple people here talking about how you buy free time. And that's your priority financially. I 1000% agree.

And then onto the next multiple year saving plan to save up for the next passion project.

I've never seen myself retiring from a company after 45 years in the same office. One week of vacation is pithy nonsense and you're lucky to get that much. Also, many of those days get eaten up by life. With things such as; family emergencies, sick days, your car broke down. You rarely get to live your life for yourself.

And our society has made us out to be the lazy ones. The immature ones. 

As long as I'm not negatively impacting anyone else around me. What does it matter? I'm lazy for being dilligent with my money and prioritizing my life over leasing the brand new car?

There's somebody on YouTube I love. Their channel name is Creativity RV. Their sister died and it compelled them to completely change their life. When their sister was sick, she said to them (I'm paraphrasing from memory).

""Are you happy with your life? Because I always imagined you in a field. Making a painting or working on your novel.""

They weren't happy. They were in a corporate job that was making them miserable. They bought a house and their boss said something along the lines of. ""I love debt equity.""

""What do you mean?""

""Now I own you for 30 years.""

They hated that, and rebelled against it. Shortly thereafter, against all ""sense"". They sold their house. Bought an RV and set off. They now make a tiny income on YouTube adsense. They have written a couple books. And little other odd things to survive. And they couldn't be happier. 

In a recent video. They talked about the importance of not working. They'll drag their couch outside the RV. Lie there and watch the clouds and sleep. Not caring about time. Until they feel fully recharged.

They do still have to work to make a living. But not in the traditional way. And in a way where they can travel full time and fully enjoy life.

I've seen a lot of people like this. I feel grateful I grew up in a home that never placed a high importance on a career or being financially successful.

I'd much rather be the hippy with the off brand hiking boots. The falling apart backpack. Knowing I have no debt. Then to be the one who gets turning heads from my vintage Cadillac that is just hemmoraging money. 

I am getting a marketing degree purely for my South Korea goals, and the other reason is because I can get it for minimal to no debt (same is true for boyfriend's degree). I've gotten criticism for this, but I really don't think it matters. I am not interested in a teaching degree. I'm not interested in a teaching career (I've had it suggested it to me because of my plans). I just like it, and can see it propelling me to my next goals. I have no idea what life looks like after 10 years from now. And I'm OK with that. I may get some skills that will help my boyfriend with his path. 

I personally think there is merit in getting a degree for the sake of having a degree. So many jobs, literally did not care what my degree was in. They just wanted me to have one. Because we have to keep creating ""Others"" in society. And even if someone ditched most of their classes. Smoked weed all day. Didn't work, and scraped by with a bunch of C- grades. 

They're more valuable than the person who went into retail work straight after high school so they could feed their family and have worked 10x as hard as the college grad.

So I'm not interested in doing the ""puritan"" college route. Where I pick a degree in my ultimate passion and sacrifice everything I have to get into that field, and then face extreme shame if I ever change my mind.

Something like only 30% of American college grads are in a job relevant to their degree. I'm just skipping the steps to get to the other 70%.

I remember a fast food job I worked. The manager told me I could get a management job if I got a business degree. All that time and money. To get *this* at the end of it? I don't know why anyone would submit themselves to that.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. My boyfriend and I are really excited for our next step. I'm excited to give him the opportunity to focus on school. I'm excited for so many of my future plans. I'm also really glad that I (hopefully) found my people. You seem to be understanding that many of us need to work. You also seem to not be the type to act like you know my life better than me (something I've been dealing with a lot lately). 

So hi! If you've got plans for the future. Anything at all. I'd love to hear them.","You seem like people who would appreciate my rant about employment ""Red flags"".",27

Sorry if this comes off as entitled/petty, but here are the things I’m struggling with:

1. Walmart is a shit company. After learning more about their business practices, I’m no longer naive to their horrible ideals and can’t claim ignorance. Working for this company makes me feel guilty as I am enabling and helping them. (watch the documentary “the high cost of low price” on YouTube)

2. My fucking feet hurt. Even with my “comfort mat” under my register it is painful. Once I wore flat-soled shoes instead of tennis shoes and my feet hurt so bad that I had to buy a new pair of tennis shoes half way through my shift.

3. Baby boomers. I’m tired of being screamed at over expired coupons. It shouldn’t piss me off but when 5 customers in a row don’t say “hello” or “thank you” back, I get a little irritable. It’s like I’m barely human.

4. Social anxiety. Before I got this job, I rarely talked to anyone. I’ve become more social and I’m able to hold conversations now, so I’m grateful I’ve tried cashiering. But I’m just an introverted person and it’s exhausting to hold conversations all day.

5. They won’t let me take off the three days I want next week for a trip. This one is petty but it’s inconvenient as I told them about it nearly two months ago and I spent money on my ticket. They usually let me have whatever day I want off but this time it’s different, I guess.

6. We’re chronically understaffed. Some days I’m the only cashier with lines of 10+ people while management dicks around and pretends not to see.

7. I have to work holidays. Maybe I’m coming off as entitled but last year was the first year I ever had to miss thanksgiving with my family because of “brown Thursday” We ate at 5, so I had 15 minutes to eat, and then went off for my shift at 5;30. 

8. Stress. I know I have one of the easiest jobs out there, but I just can’t take it. I’m just bad at social interaction and I get stressed out by all the weird demands and complaints, especially after standing around for 8+ hours.

9. I miss being outside. My days off are spent recharging. I want to go on trips with my family (I will have to miss out on ours this year because they won’t let me take it off) and I want to get back into the gym more often. I want some peace  and relaxation before I kick myself into college and a career.

10. They’re probably firing my favorite manager because??? They can and it’s convenient for them at this time. It’s all bullshit. It’s not my business to share so I won’t give info.

11. Brian is a douchebag.

Reasons I want to keep my job:

1. Money. I want to be able to go to college. Yesterday a very kind man came through my checkout and asked me what my plans were since I’d just graduated. I told him I’m taking the year off before school and he told me “the reason they pay you like this here is to encourage you to get a degree” and I just couldn’t stop thinking about how ass-backwards and absolutely untrue that was. I am a human machine. I do nothing but monotonous, simple-minded scanning day in and day out. They pay me this way because I am the human version of a self-checkout machine.

Anyways, sorry for my rant. I’m not having a good time.",Complaints from a Walmart Cashier (rant),35

It is not as much as some people, of course, but it is more than I’ve consistently done in the past. Personally I have found this to be more and more difficult as time went on. In the beginning, I was working ~40 hours a week, sometimes over, but this was eventually reduced to 30 for a bit. As of writing this, though, I have put my two weeks in, and am working 40 hours for these last two once again. Once again, many people have worked much more for much longer, and I commend them for being able to do so. I, however, have struggled in this position, and have also struggled to elaborate why, to justify my ‘need’ to work less even though others work so much more than this. In writing this I hope to both figure out for myself what the issue is, potentially giving me the ability then to explain it to others. 

The work itself is not bad. Sometimes, even, when I’m in the zone and listening to some good music, the time passes by fairly quickly. The ambivalence or enjoyment of these times, however does not subtract from the time itself or the energy it takes from me.
Compared to last summer, things have felt different. Back then, my life outside work felt less affected and still existed as the ‘focus’ of my life at the time. I would see friends, play games, do housework, and, centrally to my recent introspection, work on music. In a way, working on music in this time felt like my ‘real’ job, the wage work was just an outside activity through which I could earn some money to prepare for the school year ahead. I spent long hours composing, recording, and producing, the goal of this ‘work’ being the creation of albums and the honing of my craft and passion overall. It went along very well; though I was tired sometimes I was able to push through and create many things that I am
proud of to this day. So why, then, am I so much more tired today? 

First, let me explain how things are different. These days I seem to have lost the motivation to work on music. It may not even be motivation, as I have spent a lot of time on my computer, on my gameboy, and at the piano trying my best to compose and develop ideas. This time spent, however, has generally born little fruit; I end up frustrated with myself and even more tired than before, eventually giving up for the day because I know trying harder would only tire me out more. This frustration has bled into other things, and, though I try to keep a positive attitude about it all, it proves difficult. 

I have talked with my family and friends about this, and have not found any decisive conclusions for the sources of these feelings and issues, but I will try my best to explain my ‘working theories.’ I recently looked back at my scheduled hours from last summer and found that I worked an average of 23 hours per week, adding a new variable to the mix. This leads me to believe that the extra time this summer is part of what has weighed on me. Every day I feel the tiredness, and I know that it comes from all the time spent at work. It is not even strenuous activity, but still has this sort of effect on me, and this is what I cannot pinpoint the exact reason for. As I said before, sometimes I can find myself enjoying what I do at work. I do not think the work itself is much of the issue (though I have complained about it a lot in some sort of attempt to feel better, which hasn’t worked very well). Instead, I think it is the sheer time. I do not believe I am cut out for working 40 hours a week. Some people may say I’m not trying hard enough or that I am entitled. I don’t believe that, as I would be fine with and earning less. Money is not the issue. I only know that, when I have worked this much, I have struggled. I am weaker than those who tell me ‘everyone does it,’ I am weaker than those around me; I see these things, but I do not know if I care. I am weak.

There is a general societal expectation that people will work like this for their whole lives. I don’t want to do this, to deal with that, it drains me and prevents me from doing the things I love. I don’t know if this is the case for others, but it is taking up so much of my life, though both the time itself and then the energy removed from the time outside. I know that I must work, but if it must be like this I would rather not. I don’t know what to say beyond that. If it is ‘selfish’ or ‘entitled’ of me to want to be happy doing the thing I love, then sue me. Call me those things. I don’t care, because I know inside that that is not what it is. I am willing to work, but I need something outside to live for and to cope with it all. Music has always been my refuge, and in taking away my ability to go that place, these ‘standard’ work weeks are something I do not want to live with in the future, for the sake of my mental and spiritual health. This has been a rant that sort of moved away from its goal, but hopefully it can help others to understand what i’m feeling. I know it helped me understand it a bit better, so that is what matters.",A rant about work and my guilt and life and stuff,2

It confirmed the completion of my application and prompted me to then go to the part of the web app where I can check the status of my application...and there is like no indication of anything having been saved.  This is after previously editing my resume in an arbitrary, insignificant way that was required, turning it in, and then being asked to turn it in again as though they have never received it in the first place.

I've always told myself that I'm going to quit but I've always stuck around because it was only somewhat annoying and majorly stressful only 2-3 days of the week. 

Cut forward to this management meeting that we had today where we discussed pay raises (from about $3.50 USD/hr to $4.88 USD/hr - yay!) and incentive cuts (talk about motivation). We also discussed how I am going to become full time...

This part threw me for a loop. For a little context I am a call center quality analyst and I work 40+ hours a week grading calls for 17 agents (2 calls each), managing a team of 11 and assisting 50 agents with queries. Was I not full time previous to this meeting? Is it that I should grade the calls and go home? Why was I not told this previously?

Their idea is to get in line with industry standard where I grade 6 calls per agent weekly, manage a team of 20 and assist upwards of 50 agents (they plan to hire more agents). There was very little talk of hiring any other quality analysts and right now there is only two, me and some insufferable bootlicker (his nose is so far up their asses that his entire face is brown). If that is industry standard for such a pointless as fuck job then I'm sorry for all the other QA's in all the BPOs worldwide because listening to calls all day is a fuck ass job. (That's not even a good analogy because I'm quite sure fucking ass is at least enjoyable).

I've never liked working for this company but the meeting today really drove home the point of how unfulfilled and ultimately how shitty I feel. I think I might just put in my resignation (allowing them about a month to find a new QA) and just stay home for a while. I don't want to be out of a job but my mental health is shot to shit and I'm just not up to going through the HR gauntlet right now. I'm just tired of having to keep up this working thing and I don't even know what the point of it is (besides not starving).

I'm the exact opposite, actually. Please don't rely on this and go see a professional before making any decisions).

Whenever someone starts a thread here and shares the frustrations of the modern imprisonment system called ""work"", there's usually at least 1 comment that says *""look into the FI/RE movement"".*

**Well, I finally did.**

I had to: my savings started amounting to a decent enough amount of money, so that I had to start thinking about it. I'm not a big spender type - just minor conveniences here and there, to relieve the pain of wasting my life away in a boring office role.

I've been saving \~50% of my take-home pay easily, and the interest I get for a savings account at the bank is pathetic - about 1%, less than the rise in the cost of living. A financial advisor warned me that by letting the money just sit there, it effectively depreciates as cost of living grows. To put it simply, I'm losing money by stalling.

**The idea of FI/RE is that every dollar you don't spend matters, thanks to compound interest.** There are compound interest calculators online, that show you, for example, that $10,000 today, with a standard interest of 5%, would equate to $16,500 in a decade. Some investors can supposedly get more than the basic %5-6, if they play their cards right, perform research etc.

**But where does the 5%-or-higher interest come from exactly?**

Your bank is not likely to pay you that much for your savings account. Here, the larger banks pay a LOT less.

Some smaller banks I found pay as much as %3.5, which is also somewhat low (and perhaps a bit riskier - I've seen one bank collapse in my days as a teenager).

Then, what is considered a 'safe investment', which also pays the a significant enough interest to allow one to dream of early retirement?

\*\*\*

The answer most FI/RE types quote is **ETFs**.

I'm not an expert, but from what I read - an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund, traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. Instead of picking a stock one by one, investors can pick a fund that tracks multiple companies at once. The popular ones, which are considered ""safe"" (and often have lower management fees) track the performance of financial market indexes. You don't have to be an expert, and you don't have to hire professionals to manage your investments, which would offset all the profit if you're just an average Joe with a few grands.

Here in Australia, there are a few that track the top 200-300 ASX (Australian Stock Exchange) companies. Investors that rather put their money in the global market often choose ETFs that track Standard &amp; Poor's index ([S&amp;P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies)).

Those are just two examples, and there are many other options out there - but those are very common suggestions to people who have no financial background, can't manage the money by themselves, are risk averse etc.

And the problem?

**Once you check which companies those funds track exactly, you see what exactly you're investing in. From my perspective, they're the axis of evil. You're essentially betting on companies that do bad things.**

Here are some examples from the list of companies in the S&amp;P 500 index:

1. **Accenture** \- an IT company that hires bad-yet-cheap software developers in countries like India, as contractors; which in turn allows other companies to offshore their IT services and fire staff. I've seen that before.
2. **Activision Blizzard** \- we've had a few links on this sub around their latest shenanigans. Around Christmas, they [fired 800 employees](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/fire-activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-for-pocketing-millions-while-laying-off-800-workers), to make up for the quarterly losses - while their CEO was paid 28 million a year, for his supposedly-stellar performance.
3. **Alphabet Class A and C** \- those are the guys that gather obscene amount of information on us all, track our every online move, in order to brainwash us with ads and perpetuate consumerism.
4. **Amazon** \- their founder is the richest man on the planet, yet Bernie Sanders had to win a long battle in order to convince him to pay his warehouse staff $15 an hour. In U.K., an investigative journalist revealed that picker-packers in Amazon warehouses, whose every move is under constant surveillance lest they slack a little on the clock, [pee in BOTTLES](https://nypost.com/2018/04/16/amazon-warehouse-workers-pee-into-bottles-to-avoid-wasting-time-undercover-investigator/). They have to, in order to save time and keep their metrics up. Else they'd lose their job.
5. **Apple** \- manufactures their iPhones in Foxconn factories in China, where staff are paid very little and have a high [suicide](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract) rate.

That's just the letter A. The list is FULL of corporations that are famous for doing **nasty things for profit**.

Here are some more examples, after I scrolled down the whole thing:

* **Phrama companies** that have pushed opioids and hid the fact they're addictive from the public.
* **Oil companies**. I spotted multiple fossil fuel names.
* **Health care** providers in U.S., who lobby hard against public health care, inflate the cost of health services and fight every patient's claim.
* Some of the **banks and financial institutes** that caused the GFC are in the list. The guys who got bailed out by the U.S. government, then took the bailout money and paid HUGE bonuses to their execs.
* Someone in the comments added that there are **arms dealers** in S&amp;P 500 too. Next to those companies, Facebook and McDonald’s are relative saints. 

\*\*\*

Let's assume you're just about the money, and not letting this bother your conscience. Not judging.

You have to do what you can to survive in a capitalist economy, and you can't afford to reject the safest path to early retirement.

But who’s to say these companies are going to not just last, but grow, in 10, 20, 30 years? Especially the petroleum names in the list. Whose to say the banking system and the U.S. health care system will be the same by then?

I almost hope it won't. **In order to be optimistic about the success of your investment, you have to be quite pessimistic about the direction that the world is heading to**, and assume that our society won't improve; that we won't kick the bad, destructive habit of fossil fuel. Even Amazon's Bezos recently held a presentation about manning Mars; since he thinks we'll consume the resources here eventually, because we don't want to turn to ""rationing"" (his bleak interpretation on the degrowth movement, perhaps).

There are some alternatives, and you can probably build an ""ethical"" investment portfolio and choose less-horrible companies or indexes etc. The management fee will be far higher, and it's considered a less-safe path. Most investors don't. I see the same 3-letter acronyms on FI/RE forums, the same funds people discuss.

And they're all cancer. Lucrative cancer, at least for the time being.

\*\*\*

I'm still doing it, don't get me wrong. Billy Corgan said, ""despite of my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage"". If that's my ticket out of work, I can't afford to be ethical.

I would have bought real estate instead, but I don't have enough money to buy a tiny studio within less than an hour of my workplace (one of the axis-of-evil companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, btw). I don't think I ever will, lest I sink in debt and work for 30 years. And the majority of the population here earns less than me.

I guess I'm just venting here. But the next time someone posts that if you skip that one cappuccino or Spotify subscription, you'd be able to retire early - please be aware that they're not telling you the whole story. They're not telling you that you'd have to embrace a sickly economic  system, and hope for the best.

**TL;DR - the FI/RE movement's promise relies on the success of the least ethical companies in the world.**

The world is insane, people have way too much college debt, climate change, the amount of stress of work, and school starting hours. Most reasons for suicide are actually kind of valid this days. I think assisted suicide for the *mentally ill* needs to become legal. No one of us asked to be here. We should be able to leave on our own terms whenever we like.

Calling the suicide hotline doesn´t work, if anything they will send you to a hospital that will probably get it worse. I also don´t care if people that I love will be hurt because I will be dead as weird as that sounds. I simply don´t care. By my knowledge of possibility, I´m fine wich whatever it is, AND DON´T YOU DARE TO TRY TO USE RELIGION TO MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND IN THE COMMENTS!

We exist simply to work 40+ hours a week. We exist to make money for *others.* Most people just call depression a chemical imbalance, maybe it is, but nobody wonders what is the CAUSE of that imbalance isn´t it? Don´t blame it on smartphones before anything. It is because of how insane the world is. Deaths, evil, wageslavery, all of this is how it *is.* Anyone still wonder why are so many people killing themselves today? Most people that tell people how important they are are doing it because of their own non-sensical opmistic bias that anyone lives can be better no matter what. Wich in turn ironically made people´s lives worse. Everyone says the same thing ""it will get better, don´t do it!! Imagine how good you life could be in 5 years"" Wich is pretty much *bullshit.* Case Closed.

I know this sub is dedicated to help people with suicide toughts, but I am simply speaking the truth. The reason  we mostly live today is because we make money for the rich. And our wages are getting lower... ""Oh but imagine what woul-"" NO. I want to live on my own terms if I want to. I have a psychiatric illness, depression that causes me suffering a lot in day-to-day life, should I be able to live with it for the rest of my life. But seriously, why haven ´t they invented a cure for depression? Why is there no brain scams? Only pill- well this is for another post. But you get my point.

Also, personally, my life isn´t that bad. I will probably see a psychologist in July, she is a handsome young woman ( I prefer them because they have a more caring, kind atmosphere) and I don´t plan on killing myself... But maybe...

&amp;#x200B;

Well what I am trying to say is that you have the right to leave on yours terms if you want to. You want to get euthanized? Fine. What we need to do is going to the focus on the cause of why this chemical imbalance is happening. Not only treating the symptoms of it. We have a broken society and a broken system. That feeds on our money to survive. Even kids are teens are realizing it, wich is what /u/Compassionate_Cat/ said, no matter if kids or teens really know that, but they always have that ""Wait something is wrong"" sensation with well, everything. All of this stressing-school work, for becoming a wage slave? That would drive anyone to suicide. Here´s a quote from him:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kid's are often way more aware than adults are in a certain sense. They can sense something is wrong, even despite indoctrination. They are very clever and learn that the system is full of contradiction and insanity. Once this reaches a tipping point, either through bullying and abuse, introspection, or investigation of the world around them, a mental health breakdown is guaranteed.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to think about how the society and system we live in is aggravating the problems of depression, suicide and mental illness. We need to *change* the system. And linking a phone number or repeating phrases and throwing people into mental hospitals is not what is gonna help it.","A rant about how we need to start the treat the root of problems like depression (capitalism) that I originally put on r/suicidewatch, and expectedly got ignored.",36

Guess what? It didn't and it's gone now as every other person who was involved finally resigned.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's because I had the illusion that I actually can gain financial independence with saving a lot, investing and crypto and stuff. Guess what? Yes since I focused on it I came a long way. But realistically speaking with the annual wage I earn, it still would take at least 20-25 years and then I would be anyway near retirement age. So it's more like fuck you money for a short amount of time when I'm out of a job.

Most people on financialindependence and personalfinance are already privileged people with Master/PhD degrees and cushy jobs in big companies where they belong to the top earners. Or doctors (like MrMoneyMustache), lawyers from wealthy families. Also a near illusion that it is possible for everyone to quit their job at age 35-40.

&amp;#x200B;

So after that realization and instant feeling of being trapped set in. I've never experienced so much existential crisis like this year. It's agonizing.  On top of that my boss made it pretty clear that I simply can't stand working for him anymore.

So what did I do? I looked for another prison (employer) who maybe has some better slave (work) conditions although it's the same shitty job in a part-time way. I actually had an interview and it look promising. Soon I will know if they accept.

What did I do? I just asked for so much that I would earn the same amount for only 4 days instead of having to work for 5 days. Can't believe that they would even consider that.

That would mean 52 days more, almost 2 months more life time in a year.

He'll then go on to lecture about how anyone can do it, they just have to try harder. This comes across as condescending, and niave to me. For one, no one wants to work a ""real job"" but some people didn't get lucky or don't want to take the shot to be the 1 in 1000 people that makes enough money as a comedian to have a comfortable life. How many comedians do you think we can support? If everyone decided to be a professional comedian who would make all of the food, produce all of the goods, repair our infrastructure, and so on.

Is it nice not being trapped in a cube ? Sure. But cubicles offered at least a semblance of your own ""office"" and your own space where you could grovel and grumble on post shit like this on Reddit without the boss looking over your shoulder. There's a million ""huddle rooms"" for unnecessary meetings. The dress code is supremely casual.  There's a sort of forced effort to try and connect everybody. Particularly in the office break-room/kitchen where there is a couch, and on some floors things like Foosball tables or ping pong or whatever games. Not to mention the incessant wall of monitors constantly  playing Top 40 hits. (I work at a large multimedia corporation and am not a big fan of most of today's pop.)   I would love to  grab the remote and lower the volume if possible. You know where else I could wear jeans and a t shirt, and control the music, and play things like pool and board games with people who I actually know and like, MY HOUSE. If I wanted to do any of these things, I would do them at home. That's the whole point of having your own space and leisure time to do them. The line between work and play is becoming totally blurred and its bizarre to me.  Pick one or the other.  The article I linked below discusses WeWork

The question that usually arises is: why should people be guaranteed a baseline of security, a stable place in society, equal recognition, etc., all without any relation to their contributions to material production?  But to me it seems that the inverse can just as easily be asked:  why *don't* people automatically deserve such an existence?  Why *do* the mediocre and incompetent deserve the *punishment* which takes the form of alienation, marginalization, deprivation, the imposition of fear and shame?

It is the former perspective which privileges production and accumulation over the actual immanent *experience* of expenditure and consumption.  In other words, under capitalism we don't produce so we can consume, we consume so we can produce.  Our primary goal isn't to enjoy the free moments of life in which work can stop and we can experience the fruits of our labor, but rather to pour our energies – mentally, physically, spiritually – into work. 

This leads to the rationale that those who don't produce have no right to consume, that all of our relationships should be structured around exchange, the reciprocal trade of the present for the future, of time for value, not just in terms of material economics but also social and cultural capital.  The experience of consumption should be immanent, meaning it simply is what it is: the enjoyment of experience in the present moment, free from any purpose or deferment to the future.  This immanence is also *intimate* communication, without hierarchical distinction, without the mediation of a middle object that determines the relationship between *us* according to how we relate to *it*.  

Instead we have consumption in the form of hierarchical luxury: the abstraction by which social recognition becomes tied to excessive consumption without any reference to actual experience.  Take the example of the jewel, which offers us very little in terms of actual experience.  It's a bit shiny, a bit enjoyable to look at, but not enough to justify its value.  What truly justifies the value of the jewel is its exclusivity, i.e. the degree to which owning one means that others also won't own one.  What is spent on the jewel is not just money, but *people* - in the jewel, *people* are being consumed, producing the *experience* of pride in a transcendent class hierarchy.  This transcendent consumption is the one and only form of consumption which shuts people off from each other, which precludes intimacy and communication by basing its experience entirely on social relativity.  Yet it is the form of consumption which matters the most to us.  

All of us work harder than we need to, produce more than we need to, put more pressure on ourselves than we need to, subject ourselves to more existential crises than we need to, punish ourselves with guilt and shame more than we need to, **all so that someone can feel transcendent, a feeling which by definition cannot be shared with any of us**.

I go in for this interview today, which is the 3rd round already, with the Marketing Director. So I take my time to prepare, research, all that bs.

I get there 10min early (the interview is scheduled for 8h30am). It is 8h50 and they haven't called me yet, when another candidate shows up (maybe it was the one scheduled for 9h00am?)

When it is like 9h05 they call me, and I'm already pretty pissed at this point. Turns out, the Marketing Director is too busy to interview me, so a manager comes and guess what: she haven't even read my resume, so I have to lose several minutes explaining my past experiences. 

Out of nowhere the Marketing Director comes and I have to start explaining things again (turns out que didn't read my CV either...) when his phone rings and he abruptly leaves the room.

So, after I finished the interview I know I pretty much failed it as the manager has no further questions and wants to check if the Director has any. 

So she leaves the room and I proceed to wait another 10min until the director comes and ask me a very dumb question and thanks me for my time. I leave confused while I overhear they talking in the background (in a very rude manner) that I'm not what they were looking for (no wonder, they didn't even read my CV). 

Maybe I'm overreacting, but I never felt more disrespected in an interview. I'm seriously considering writing about it on LoveMondays (our version of Glassdoor) and even complaining to their HR (which will accomplish nothing, I know).

Average lifespan in my country is 80 years.  
The first 20 years of your life is you trying to figure things out.  So it doesn't count.  
The last 20 years of your life is you too old to do anything with your life.

Why did I let them convince myself to work on saturday/sunday, just for a 2% raise that may or may not happen each year?

Why did I fall for this scam.  I am now happier at a shit-paying night job where 99% of the shift has me do nothing since I am in a building alone.  I spend all my hours working on a business that will eventually make me money.  

I am much happier despite being in poverty, beceause now I don't feel like I am working anymore.  The most I do is put my uniform on, unlock and lock the doors.

Now I still live in a vehicle but I'm saving about $1k a month. And honestly my van had more utility so living in a truck is a slight decrease in quality of life. In my van I had propane (this isn't legal in a truck). In my van I had 300 watts of solar power and a 230ah 12v battery bank. The trucks only power is from idling and if the temp is between 20-70 degrees it shuts off after 5 minutes if you don't step in the gas. In my van I had 3 5 gallon jugs for water. I'm spending a bunch more on water bottles now. In my van I had a diy sink. I can't even wash myself as well as I could in the van when I can't get a shower because there's nowhere to wring my rag into so I pretty much wash my face and neck, and add some more water to my rag and do my hair. I used to be able to do my entire body by wringing the rag into my sink, adding fresh water and maybe more baking soda, and continuing.

Anyway, this fucking mini game. I've got bipolar II and anxiety and whatever else and have never been able to tolerate jobs for very long. At the end of which my aversions have gotten even stronger and can tolerate the next job for even less time. Trucking is the last thing I can tolerate because I've never minded driving much and that's about 70% of what trucking is. The last job I tried getting I lasted 3 days. Others have been anywhere from a few months to 1 year and a month at the longest. So I've got a very limited amount of time. Having a year of experience secures a lot more opportunities in the future, which I'm aiming for even if I don't think I'll be capable of actually trying something at that point. I'm barely holding on though. Most days are a struggle. 

The mini game is that I know very soon my mental state isn't going to be able to do this anymore and I'll quit or be fired. At which point however much I've saved up is how long I have left to live. My money is HP bar. So accumulate as much HP as you can, no matter how much it is it won't be enough, and there's no limit to the amount you need, and you have no idea when the mini game ends so you better hurry. Well getting UBI is my only long term chance. I've promised myself to stay alive long enough to see Andrew yang lose because I've been talking about ubi for the past few years and it'd be hilarious to kms right before we finally get it.

Well this feeling of playing a futile mini game before a boss fight where money is my HP bar for that boss fight was the main point of this post but I've already made this very verbose so I'll continue to rant.

Between crypto investments and my bank account I have $10k right now. This is more money than I've ever had on hand at one time but in the context of being my health bar for the future any amount is completely unsatisfying and not enough. My options after I burn out from this job are: 

go back to the van life as I was but get my van re-registered and insured since a year in I couldn't afford that anymore and it was a big source of anxiety about having everything I own stolen by cops or arrested, for being poor. I'd be able to live on $500 a month in that case. The negative with this is it ties my life to the life of my van. Any critical breakdown and I wouldn't afford it and I'd die.

Get an apartment and finally live with basic comfort for a year, after 3 years of living in vehicles. This is really tempting. I'm really tired of living in vehicles. Just having a toilet and water and a shower available whenever I want is a huge luxury. I haven't had a mailing address for the past 2.6 years either lol. This option is $1000 a month so I'd have about a year. After which I'd probably just have to kill myself. But at least my final year would be comfortable. 

Get land and have a well drilled. This option is the one I'm actually leaning towards. It's actually not as simple as it sounds. Most counties don't actually allow you to exist on land you own and pay property tax on every year unless you build a home of a minimum sqft to strict building codes that are half for safety and half to profit people. Typically it's something like ""camping is allowed 180 days in a 12 month period"" or less. Beyond that, a well would cost ~10k. The land itself would be a few thousand. And if I don't find it in a county that allows it, I may be evicted and told to go be homeless elsewhere anyway. And it's still a life of poverty and no comfort. This option has a high upfront cost and then a mostly indefinite time frame though.

These options are all shit. I'd might as well pick a year of comfort and a peaceful suicide method.",[rant] This fucking boss level mini game,8

I'm sick of it. I'm fucking sick of it. Sorry, but I have a clear line in the fucking sand. This is just what I do to pay the bills, fuck off.

They had the balls to set  me up training for this job that i told them i didn't want  and not even bump my pay the three dollars an hour extra .

Well yesterday morning driving in i told myself im gonna stick to my word and tell them  i cant do this. I did it! No drama no fuss. 

Its been a long time that ive stuck to my beliefs. Its been a long time that I didn't go out of my way to people please!

I work in a back office dealing with paperwork, where you can't talk or move. A lady got in trouble for putting her bag on the desk in the morning.  Another lady had to hide her coat because it was pink and was too bright to put on the coat hangers near the door. You start getting punished for a Bradford score of 15. People buy their own stationery because the company refuses to buy it. We aren't allowed to wear boots because the HR manager doesn't think they're smart.

My daily tasks are spoonfed to me, and if I run out of work I have to ask what I'm allowed to do next. Every single mistake is announced in front of the whole team, and everyone is encouraged to grass on each other. We had to do overtime to do essential job training.

It's so humiliating to be treated like a child or an idiot, and to be micromanaged so much that you can't move an inch. I feel like a robot on a production line.

Also some of the older team members have been brainwashed to police you - if you're heard complaining they tell on you. Nevermind the fact they've worked there for years and their pay is still near minimum wage. Everyone talks behind each other's backs. 

I thought it was just call centres that are toxic, but in truth all jobs are.

I wish I could just leave and be a SAHM, but my husband is also stuck in a low pay dead end job. I don't want to be a corporate drone, I want to take care of a family. I don't want my children to be raised by childminders and other staff. Has anyone managed to do this?

My day to day work can be accomplished in roughly 1-2 hours on an average day, maybe I'll respond to 5-10 emails and take a few phone calls throughout the rest of the day, but really I'm just sitting here pretending to look busy with Reddit opened on one screen and my completed work open on another. I could easily do about 90% of my work from home and at least be productive during the day but I am forced to sit here for 8.5 hours because that's ""how things have always been"" It truly bothers me and makes absolutely no sense to me that I can't just come in for 2 hours and get all my work done and go on about my day answering emails and phone calls when they come.

I have actually thought about work and ""progress"" a lot since then and these are a few things I've come to the conclusion of (so far). I'm really open minded and open to discussion on any of them!

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary: True progression is not being achieved currently, due to crab in a bucket mentality, and lack of knowledge as to other options. Movements like what this subreddit promotes will help heal the people and make the world a much better place.**

&amp;#x200B;

* We are not *truly* progressing as a society even with all of our hours we are putting in.
   * Contrary to what I've heard before, having more children is not progression as a species. Living longer lives is not necessarily progression either. What does it matter if you live for 70 years? Especially after 50+ of those years spending 5/7 days for someone else? By the time you have any amount of money saved up and can stop working your body is already one leg in the grave, not to mention your mind. 
   * We essentially live until we get to the point that we lose our minds and then are subject to relentless marketing (infomercials, gambling, alcohol). More and more people are being born into this system and see absolutely none of the good stuff when its good, but still have to experience all of the bad when its bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

* People are usually bitter to you if you do not work and they do.
   * I just came back home after being on the road for a couple of months. I've been having car trouble and because of the holidays I haven't been able to get my car in the shop for a while, so I'm staying at my parents place (on the floor.) My mother and father have an oddly strong work ethic considering how they are when they are off of work, but for a bit of background ever since I've turned 16 they've been hounding me to get a job so I could buy stuff even though I had just about everything I could ever need.  They make a crazy amount of money yet growing up I remember they would always say how they couldn't buy stuff because we were living paycheck to paycheck. My dad wakes up at 4 and then gets ready and after his commute he gets to work at 7. He usually comes home around 6 and then proceeds to get drunk. 
      * In this little anecdote (which I've also had confirmed to me by asking my friends about their parents) I'm trying to say how it's obvious they are both unhappy and in need of some form of escape, yet they think work is the only way forward. If work really was good, where would the yelling come from? Where would the alcoholism, divorce rate, and drug use rate (including prescription) come from? 

&amp;#x200B;

* People expect work to be unpleasant.
   * Of course, at some points work can be hard, and uncomfortable. This is the process of growth and it would be just as wrong to do something that didn't make you a little bit uncomfortable. And at the end of the day work is still *work,* but for some reason it really doesn't sit right with me to have a real person working a completely unproductive job. It's essentially a mental prison where you get to distract your mind from your shitty life in exchange to be able to go home after confinement to relax and stuff yourself to get some energy for the next day. Think of all of the time for art and social interaction and searching for meaning we could have if we just worked less? It's a lot harder to be impatient when you actually have an abundance of time and patience is something everybody could work on.

&amp;#x200B;

* For men especially and  increasingly for women, a lot of people will think less of you if you work an ""unprestigious"" job. 
   * I'm really happy right now. I have a beautiful girlfriend, I've been on a roadtrip for a while and just working minimally for food, and I've been getting a lot of time for all the things I love (reading, writing, making friends). Yet on at least two occasions people have criticized my life decisions because they aren't societally ideal (no college, no job, no desire for success). And don't get me wrong, I respect the opinion of each of these people and have been looking to see how I can improve, but I can tell these aren't the happiest people. It's a common thing I've noticed, people give you weird looks if you are ever walking around and smiling or laughing. People go like ""Why the fuck is that guy so happy?"" It's a polarizing thing but unhappy people tend to create more unhappy people in my experience. Because of that I have always tried my hardest to be as positive and kind as possible to everyone I meet and to not let any negative person drag me down. People are deeply sad right now even if not obvious, movements like these are going to be what hopefully starts the healing of our countries spirit.

A final little note:

&amp;#x200B;

This is probably not the coherent, I didn't write this with any structure in mind so excuse the rambling bits but I hope the message rings clear. Work is increasingly becoming less and less of the answer as our work moves away from directly satisfying survival needs. We find no great long term joy in being a grocery clerk bagger. What we find joy in is making a deep connection, teaching someone or being taught, finding love, having a family. These are the things that really matter, and we need to bring them back!",A Rant From a 22 Year Old,16

Honestly just thinking about it as I type this post is nearly making me shake from anger. I've seen so many videos &amp; photos on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube etc. of people who can just do absolutely **MAGNIFICENT** things. Examples that come to mind are artwork people have made, short-films, innovative/fun inventions, and more. But in every single comment section, there's ALWAYS that one dickhead who spews shit like, ""What a waste of time"", ""You have way too much free-time, get a job"", ""Don't you have a job?"". ""Can you even make money off of this?""


Man, it drives me nuts. These clowns talk down to people who have talents that they could never dream of having, as if they're better than them because they're passionless and devote their mundane, empty lives to proudly slaving under their corporate dictator? To them, unless something in life is monetized, it's worthless.

If they don't say that, then they lied to you. Plain and simple. Nobody ""wants"" to work for you, if you don't believe me, then tell all of the employees that they can stay but will no longer paid. Watch how quickly they all leave you.

I don't care about your ""vision"" or your company. I don't have an ounce of loyalty or allegiance for you or anybody there, and I never will. Because I know that at the end of the day, I'm simply viewed as a tool there. I'll be cut off with no hesitation if it profits the company more, or actually for any reason whatsoever. And you know what? I'm cool with that. I'll play the role &amp; be your tool when I'm there to get my money, absolutely no strings attached. But drop this bullshit ""company spirit"" idea.
